| **Component**                | **Data Type** | **Example Value**       | **Description & Possible Values**      |
|------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **name**                     | string        | `"stream_8"`                          | Unique identifier for the stream. Each stream should have a unique name.                                                                                                            |
| **`namespace`**                | string        | `"otter_db"`                          | Grouping or database name that the stream belongs to. It helps organize streams by logical or physical data sources.                                                                |
| **`type_schema`**             | object        | *(JSON object with properties)*       | Defines the structure of the records in the stream. Contains a properties object that maps each field (key) to its allowed data types (e.g., string, integer, array, object).    |
| **`supported_sync_modes`**     | array         | `["full_refresh", "cdc"]`             | Lists the synchronization modes the stream supports. Typically includes `"full_refresh"` for complete reloads and `"cdc"` (change data capture) for incremental updates.      |
| **`source_defined_primary_key`** | array         | `["_id"]`                             | Specifies the field(s) that uniquely identify a record within the stream. This key is used to ensure data uniqueness and integrity.                                                |
| **`available_cursor_fields`**  | array         | `[]`                                  | Lists fields that can be used to track the synchronization progress. Often empty if no cursors are required or defined.                                                              |
| **`sync_mode`**                | string        | `"cdc"`                               | Indicates the active synchronization mode. This field is set to either `"cdc"` for change data capture or `"full_refresh"` when a complete data reload is used.                |
