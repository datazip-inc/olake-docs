### `streams.json` Configuration



    #### Overall File Structure

    The `streams.json` file is organized into two main sections:

    - **`selected_streams`:** Lists the streams that have been chosen for processing. These are grouped by namespace.
    - **`streams`:** Contains an array of stream definitions. Each stream holds details about its data schema, supported synchronization modes, primary keys, and other metadata.

    #### 1. Selected Streams

    The **`selected_streams`** section groups streams by their namespace(database name). For example, the configuration might look like this:

    <SelectedStreamsOnly/>

    #### Details about all the fields mentioned in selected streams

    <SelectedStreamsOnlyDetails/>

    #### 2. Streams

    The **streams** section is an array where each element is an object that defines a specific data stream. Each stream object includes a **stream** key that holds the configuration details. For example, one stream definition looks like this:

    <StreamsOnly/>


    #### 2.1 Stream Configuration Elements

    <StreamsOnlyDetails/>
