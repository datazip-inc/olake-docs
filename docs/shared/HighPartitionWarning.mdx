:::warning Resource Requirements for High Partition Counts
When configuring partitions, consider the RAM requirements based on your partition count and thread configuration:

**RAM Calculation:**
- Each partition writer can consume approximately **20-50 MB** of RAM when processing data
- Total RAM needed ≈ **Number of threads × Number of partitions × 20-50 MB**
- Example: With 10 threads and 1000 partitions, you may need **256-512 GB RAM**

**Instance Sizing Recommendations:**
- For high partition counts (1000+ partitions with multiple threads), use a **512 GB RAM instance**
- For very high partition counts, consider scaling to a **1 TB RAM instance** 

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Reduce thread count**: Lowering the number of threads reduces concurrent partition writers and RAM usage
- **Optimize partition granularity**: Avoid creating too many small partitions; aim for partitions with meaningful data volumes
