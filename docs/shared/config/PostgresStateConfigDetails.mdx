|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`type`**          | string        | Identifies the type of state stored. For streaming replication, it is typically set to `"STREAM"`.                                               | `"STREAM"`                                                                                   |
| **`streams`**       | array         | An array that contains one or more stream state objects. Each object represents the replication state for a specific table or partition.         | `[ { ... } ]`                                                                                |
| **`stream`**        | string        | Within each stream object, this specifies the unique identifier (often the table name) whose state is being tracked.                               | `"sample_table"`                                                                             |
| **`namespace`**     | string        | Indicates the database name or logical grouping the stream belongs to.                                                                         | `"main"`                                                                                     |
| **`sync_mode`**     | string        | Represents the active synchronization mode for the stream. It may be left empty or specify a mode such as `"cdc"`.                                 | `""` (empty string)                                                                          |
| **`state`**         | object        | Contains the details required to resume replication. This nested object holds the exact point up to which data has been processed.                | `{ "binlog_file": "mysql-bin.000003", "binlog_position": 1027, "chunks": [], "server_id": 1000 }` |
| **`binlog_file`**   | string        | (Nested in `state`) The name of the binary log file from which replication will resume.                                                         | `"mysql-bin.000003"`                                                                         |
| **`binlog_position`** | integer     | (Nested in `state`) The specific position in the binary log file indicating where to resume.                                                     | `1027`                                                                                       |
| **`chunks`**        | array         | (Nested in `state`) An array for storing chunk information, useful for managing segmented or large datasets.                                      | `[]`                                                                                         |
| **`server_id`**     | integer       | (Nested in `state`) The identifier of the source MySQL server that generated the binary logs, used for ensuring correct replication tracking. | `1000`                                                                                       |

## How It Works

- **State Tracking:**  
  The `type` field declares the kind of state (here, a streaming state), while the `streams` array holds one or more stream objects. Each stream object tracks the replication state for a particular table or partition.

- **Resuming Synchronization:**  
  The `state` object inside each stream contains fields like `binlog_file` and `binlog_position` which tell the system exactly where to resume data replication. This prevents reprocessing already synced records.

- **Handling Data Chunks:**  
  The `chunks` field, although empty in this sample, can be used to manage segmented data, which is useful when handling large datasets.

- **Source Identification:**  
  The `server_id` field helps identify which MySQL serverâ€™s binary logs are being tracked, ensuring consistency in multi-server replication setups.
