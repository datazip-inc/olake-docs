| catalog_type      | hive                             | Indicates the catalog type used by the writer. "hive" means that the writer uses the Hive Metastore for catalog operations.                           |
| iceberg_s3_path   | `s3a://warehouse/` or `gs://hive-dataproc-generated-bucket/hive-warehouse`                | Determines the S3 path or storage location for Iceberg data. The value "s3a://warehouse/" represents the designated S3 bucket or directory. If using GCP, use dataproc hive metastore bucket.          |
| aws_region        | us-east-1                        | Specifies the AWS region associated with the S3 bucket where the data is stored.                                                                     |
| aws_access_key    | admin                            | Provides the AWS access key used for authentication when connecting to S3.                                                                         |
| aws_secret_key    | password                         | Provides the AWS secret key used for authentication when connecting to S3.                                                                         |
| s3_endpoint       | http://localhost:9000            | Specifies the endpoint URL for the S3 service. This may be used when connecting to an S3-compatible storage service like MinIO running on localhost. |
| hive_uri          | `thrift://localhost:9083` or `thrift://METASTORE_IP:9083`          | Defines the URI of the Hive Metastore service that the writer will connect to for catalog interactions. `METASTORE_IP` will be provided by GCP's Hive dataproc metastore.                                             |
| s3_use_ssl        | false                            | Indicates whether SSL is enabled for S3 connections. "false" means that SSL is disabled for these communications.                                   |
| s3_path_style     | true                             | Determines if path-style access is used for S3. "true" means that the writer will use path-style addressing instead of the default virtual-hosted style. |
| hive_clients      | 5                                | Specifies the number of Hive clients allocated for managing interactions with the Hive Metastore.                                                    |
| hive_sasl_enabled | false                            | Indicates whether SASL authentication is enabled for the Hive connection. "false" means that SASL is disabled.                                       |
| iceberg_db        | olake_iceberg                    | Specifies the name of the Iceberg database to be used by the destination configuration.                                                                 |
