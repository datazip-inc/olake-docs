`PATH_TO_OLAKE_DIRECTORY` is the absolute path where you have created the directory [as discussed above].
`-v "$HOME/PATH_TO_OLAKE_DIRECTORY:/mnt/config" \` maps to `-v /Users/JOHN_DOE_USERNAME/Desktop/projects/OLAKE_DIRECTORY:/mnt/config \` in macOS and Linux systems. Follow the same pattern in other systems.
