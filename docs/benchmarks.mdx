### PostgreSQL → Apache Iceberg Connector Benchmark

**Benchmark Environment**

- This benchmark uses standard [NYC Taxi Data](https://github.com/toddwschneider/nyc-taxi-data) `trips` and `fhv_trips` tables.
- The original repo ingests data into local postgres, so we have modified it to ingest into remote cloud postgres (Azure Flexible DB) [NYC Taxi Data](https://github.com/datazip-inc/nyc-taxi-data-benchmark/tree/remote-postgres)
- Total rows **4,008,587,913 rows** including both tables.  
- The average row size is **144 bytes** for `trips` and **121 bytes** for `fhv_trips`.  
- OLake & Debezium were run on  **Azure Standard D64ls v5 VM (64 vCPUs, 128 GiB memory)**, other platforms are used as a cloud offering (Fivetran, Estuary, Airbyte)
- Database instance: **Azure Standard_D32ads_v5 (32 vCores, 128 GiB Memory, 51200 max IOPS)**

_(OLake vs. Popular Data-Movement Tools)_

#### 1. Speed Comparison – **Full-Load Performance**

| Tool                                               | Rows Synced | Throughput (rows / sec) | Relative to OLake  |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| **OLake** <br/><span className='text-xs text-slate-500'>(as of 14th Sept 2025)</span>         | **4.01 B**  | **3,19,562 RPS**        | –                  |
| Fivetran <br/><span className='text-xs text-slate-500'>(as of 30th Apr 2025)</span>           | 4.01 B      | 46,395 RPS              | **6.8 × slower**   |
| Debezium (memiiso) <br/><span className='text-xs text-slate-500'>(as of 30th Apr 2025)</span> | 1.28 B      | 14,839 RPS              | **21.5 × slower**  |
| Estuary <br/><span className='text-xs text-slate-500'>(as of 30th Apr 2025)</span>            | 0.34 B      | 3,982 RPS               | **80.2 × slower**¹ |
| Airbyte Cloud <br/><span className='text-xs text-slate-500'>(as of 30th Apr 2025)</span>      | 12.7 M      | 457 RPS                 | **699.2 × slower** |


¹ _Estuary ran the same 24-hour window but processed a ~10× smaller dataset, so its throughput looks even lower when normalized._

**Memory usage (OLake)** - `Standard D64ls v5 (64 vcpus, 128 GiB Memory)`

| Memory Stats | Usage (GB) |
|--------|----|
| Min    | 3.54 |
| Max    | 58.85 |
| Mean   | 44.10 |

> OLake maintains high throughput while keeping memory usage efficient.

::::info
1. The time elapsed for all the tools was 24 hours, but OLake and Fivetran were able to process the entire dataset in that time. Airbyte failed with a sync after 7.5 hours, so we only have throughput for the first part of the test.
::::

**Key takeaway:** **OLake** now delivers upto **7x faster bulk-load** performance than **Fivetran**, while outpacing every other open-source alternative by **21x** to over **600x**.

#### 2. Speed Comparison – **Change-Data-Capture (CDC)**

| Tool               |   CDC Window | Throughput (rows / sec) | Relative to OLake |
| ------------------ | -----------: | ----------------------: | ----------------- |
| **OLake**          | **20.1 min** |          **41,390 RPS** | –                 |
| Fivetran           |       31 min |              26,910 RPS | **1.5 × slower**  |
| Debezium (memiiso) |       60 min |              13,808 RPS | **2.9 × slower**  |
| Estuary            |        4.5 h |               3,085 RPS | **13.4 × slower**   |
| Airbyte Cloud            |         23 h |                 585 RPS | **70.7 × slower**   |

::::info
The rows synced in the CDC test were the same 50 million changes that OLake processed in 20.1 minutes. The other tools were tested on the same dataset, but they had different CDC windows (timings).
::::

**Key takeaway:** For incremental workloads OLake leads the pack, moving 50 million PostgreSQL changes into Iceberg **53 % faster than Fivetran** and **10-70× faster than other OSS connectors**.

#### 3. Cost Comparison (Vendor List Prices)

| Tool          | Scenario        |                                                                           Spend (USD) |  Rows Synced |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | -----------: |
| **OLake**     | Full Load / CDC | Cost of a `Standard D64ls v5 (64 vcpus, 128 GiB memory)` running for 4.7 hours < $ 12 | 4.01 B / 50M |
| Fivetran      | Full Load       |                                                                 $ 0 (free full sync) |       4.01 B |
| Estuary       | Full Load       |                                                                              $ 1,668 |       0.34 B |
| Airbyte Cloud | Full Load       |                                                                              $ 5,560 |       12.7 M |
| Fivetran      | CDC             |                                                                              $ 2, 375.80 |         50 M |
| Estuary       | CDC             |                                                                              $ 17.63 |         50 M |
| Airbyte Cloud | CDC             |                                                                             $ 148.95 |         50 M |

- **OLake** is open-source and can be deployed on your own Kubernetes cluster or cloud VMs; you pay only for the compute and storage you provision.

### MongoDB Benchmarks

In the fast-paced world of data management, every second counts. When it comes to syncing massive datasets from MongoDB into a data warehouse or even a lakehouse, you need a tool that is not just reliable but also blazing fast and cost-effective.

This is where **OLake** comes into picture.

## Speed Comparison: Full Load Performance

For a collection of **230 million rows (664.81GB)** from Twitter data*, here's how OLake compares to leading competitors:

| Tool       | Full Load Time | Performance |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **OLake**  | 46 mins       | X times     |
| **Fivetran** | 4 hours 39 mins (279 mins) | 6x slower |
| **Airbyte** | 16 hours (960 mins) | 20x slower |
| **Debezium (Embedded)** | 11.65 hours (699 mins) | 15x slower |

OLake is **up to 20x faster** than competitors like Airbyte, significantly reducing the time and resources required for full data syncs.

No more waiting for hours or even days for your data to be loaded into your warehouse. **46 minutes** is all you need to process **230 million rows** with OLake.

::::note
We used Debezium server version v2.6.2 for carrying out these benchmarks.
::::

## CDC Sync Performance

Testing with **1 Million Rows (2.88GB, 999450 records)** across **10 collections** showed how efficiently we do it:

| Tool       | CDC Sync Time | Records per Second (r/s) | Performance |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **OLake**  | 28.3 sec             | 35,694 r/s              | X times     |
| **Fivetran** | 3 min 10 sec         | 5,260 r/s               | 6.7x slower |
| **Airbyte** | 12 min 44 sec        | 1,308 r/s               | 27.3x slower |
| **Debezium (Embedded)** | 12 min 44 sec | 1,308 r/s | 27.3x slower |

OLake processes **1 million records in just 28.3 seconds**, achieving **35,694 records per second (r/s)**, which is **6.7x faster** than Fivetran and a  **27.3x faster** than Airbyte and Debezium (Embedded).

## Cost Comparison (Considering 230M first full load & 50M CDC rows per month as of 30th Sep)

When it comes to pricing, OLake is not just faster; it's **cost-efficient**. Here's the breakdown based on a typical use case involving a **230 million-row first full sync** and **50 million CDC rows per month**:

| Tool       | First Full Sync Cost | CDC Sync Cost (Monthly) | Total Monthly Cost | Info | Factor |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|------|--------|
| **OLake**  | 10-50 USD            | 250 USD                         | 300 USD           | Heavier instance required only for 1-2 hours | X times |
| **Fivetran** | Free                 | 6000 USD                        | 6000 USD         | 15 min sync frequency, pricing for 50M rows & standard plan | 20x costlier |
| **Airbyte** | 6000 USD             | 1408 USD                        | 7400 USD         | First Load - 1.15 TB data synced | 24.6x costlier |
| **Debezium MSK connect + AWS MSK serverless** | - | - | 100 USD + 800 USD = 900 USD | 1.2 TB total data (CDC & first full sync) | 3x costlier |

OLake offers a total cost of just **300 USD per month**, compared to **6000 USD for Fivetran** and a staggering **7400 USD for Airbyte**.

That's **20x more cost-effective than Fivetran** and **24x cheaper than Airbyte**.
