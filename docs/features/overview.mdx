# Olake Features Overview

### Native BSON Extraction: 
We pull data in its raw BSON form from MongoDB, decoding it on the ETL side. This approach maintains fidelity and boosts speed.

### Parallel Chunking: 
Instead of serial reads, we split big collections into smaller virtual chunks to parallelize the process.

### CDC Cursor Preservation: 
We never lose track of CDC offsets; even if a new large collection is added later, we do a full snapshot for it without interrupting ongoing incremental sync.

### Custom Alerts: 
Configurable alerts for schema changes let you address issues quickly, preventing data corruptions or silent failures.

### Open Format for Freedom: 
By embracing Parquet and Iceberg, we side-step vendor lock-in and enable multi-engine querying.

Both full snapshot and CDC are resumable as and when required by the customer.

Estimated time duration for the initial snapshot to be completed so you have a better insight on whatâ€™s going on inside the hood.
