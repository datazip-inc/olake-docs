# Logs

A `olake.log` file will be automatically created inside `<type_of_activity><TIMESTAMP_IN_UTC>`, example `sync_2025-2-17_11-41-40` directly where your `source.json` and `destination.json` files has been created.

This holds the complete snapshot of all the logs that are being generate.

and has the color specs:

```go

"info":  "\033[32m", // Green
"warn":  "\033[33m", // Yellow
"error": "\033[31m", // Red
"fatal": "\033[31m", // Red
```

## Log retention
OLake includes an automated log retention system that helps manage disk space by automatically cleaning up old log files. This feature prevents log files from accumulating indefinitely and consuming excessive storage space.

### What it does
- Runs daily at midnight (00:00 server's local timezone) using a cron job
- Deletes entire log directories that are older than the configured retention period (defaults to 30 days)
- Only affects Olake's data

### Configuration
Set the `LOG_RETENTION_PERIOD` environment variable to control how long logs are kept:

```yml
# In docker-compose.yml
services:
  olake-ui:
    environment:
      LOG_RETENTION_PERIOD: "30"  # Keep logs for 30 days
```

### Monitoring
The system logs cleanup activities:
```
Log cleaner started...
Deleting folder /path/to/olake/logs/job-123
```
