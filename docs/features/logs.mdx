# Logs

A `olake.log` file will be automatically created inside `<type_of_activity><TIMESTAMP_IN_UTC>`, example `sync_2025-2-17_11-41-40` directly where your `source.json` and `destination.json` files has been created.

This holds the complete snapshot of all the logs that are being generate.

The console logs are shown in the below format:

and has the color specs:

```go
"debug": "\033[36m", // Cyan
"info":  "\033[32m", // Green
"warn":  "\033[33m", // Yellow
"error": "\033[31m", // Red
"fatal": "\033[31m", // Red
```

## Log retention
OLake includes an automated log retention system that helps manage disk space by automatically cleaning up old log files. This feature prevents log files from accumulating indefinitely and consuming excessive storage space.

### What it does
- Runs daily at midnight (00:00 server's local timezone) using a cron job
- Deletes entire log directories that are older than the configured retention period (defaults to 30 days)

### Configuration
Set the `LOG_RETENTION_PERIOD` environment variable in the docker-compose of [olake-ui](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake-ui)  to control how long logs are kept:

```yml
# In docker-compose.yml
services:
  temporal-worker:
    environment:
      LOG_RETENTION_PERIOD: "30"  # Keep logs for 30 days
```

### Monitoring
The log cleanup process can be monitored through the logs of the `temporal-worker` service defined in the docker-compose configuration for [olake-ui](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake-ui).

When the log cleaner starts, it emits a log entry indicating the beginning of the process:
```
Log cleaner started... 
```

Everytime the cron job runs, it emits the following log:
```
Running log cleaner...
```

As each log directory is deleted, a log entry is generated showing the full path of the directory being removed:
```
Deleting folder /path/to/olake/logs
```
