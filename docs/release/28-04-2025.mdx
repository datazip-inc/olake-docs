# 28-04-2025 Release notes

### **Breaking Changes**

* **`catalog.json` renamed to `streams.json`**  
    [\#246](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/pull/246) — As part of improved terminology and consistency, OLake now expects stream configuration to be defined in a file named `streams.json` instead of `catalog.json`.  
  ⚠️ **This is a backward-incompatible change.** Existing pipelines or DAGs must update the file name to continue functioning correctly.


### **Core OLake Changes**

#### **🔧 Enhancements & Features**

* **Hive Catalog Support**  
    [\#226](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/pull/226) — OLake now supports syncing to Apache Iceberg tables using Hive catalog integration.

* **Lakekeeper Integration for REST Catalogs**  
    REST-based catalogs can now be orchestrated with Lakekeeper for better sync lifecycle control.

* **Iceberg Partitioning Logic**  
    [\#227](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/pull/227) — Native partitioning support added to Iceberg writer for optimized data layout.

* **Fallback ID Generation (`olakeID`)**  
    [\#225](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/pull/225) — OLake now auto-generates a consistent `olakeID` if no primary key is present in a record.

#### **🛠 Improvements & Fixes**

* **Updated to Iceberg Writer `v1.7.2`**  
   [**\#252**](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/pull/252) **—** Switched to Iceberg 1.7.2 to resolve an issue with S3 connections not closing promptly when using the Hive catalog.

* **Handle Special Double Values (NaN, Infinity, \-Infinity)**  
    [\#251](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/pull/251) — Fixed ingestion failures due to unsupported float values in source data.  
   Fixes: [\#109](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/issues/109)

* **Improved Logging for Iceberg Sync Failures**  
    [\#239](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/pull/239) — Enhanced logging output with clearer and color-coded error messages for debugging sync failures.

* **Pre-commit Hook Integration**  
    [\#178](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/pull/178) — Added automated formatting and linting checks via pre-commit hooks to enforce code standards.


### **🔌 Connector Releases**

#### **🐘 Postgres Connector — `v0.0.4`**

* Resolved data types issues. Now more consistent, accurate and destination column data types are identical to DB ones.

#### **🍃 MongoDB Connector — `v0.0.10`**

* Addition of primitive data type support: [\#247](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/pull/247)  
* Improved performance in syncing high-volume collections.
