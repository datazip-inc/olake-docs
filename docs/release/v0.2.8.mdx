## üîß Bug Fixes & Stability

1. **Process timeout and database prefix configuration -** <br/>Fixed process timeout handling and database prefix configuration for GitHub Actions runners. Added the `--destination-database-prefix` flag to both `sync` and `discover` commands to resolve database naming conflicts with GitHub runner restrictions that require the `performance_ prefix`. Additionally, fixed sync timeout behavior where containerized jobs continued running after timeout by implementing manual process termination, ensuring complete cleanup and preventing resource leaks in CI/CD environments.

2. **gRPC port binding race condition -** <br/>Fixed gRPC port binding failures caused by race conditions between processes. When one Java process finished with a gRPC port and another quickly attempted to bind to it, the OS required up to several minutes to fully release the port, causing binding failures. This fix implements proper handling to avoid port conflicts during rapid process restarts, improving reliability in containerized environments.

3. **Duplicate table creation by threads -** <br/>Previously, multiple threads attempted to create table simultaneously, intermittently failing when the table already existed and throwing errors. The logic now catches and handles the ‚Äúalready exists‚Äù condition, preventing threads failures during parallel workloads.
