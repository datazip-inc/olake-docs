# OLake (v0.1.6 â€“ v0.1.8)
July 17 â€“ July 30, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ What's New

### Sources

1. **Incremental Sync: MongoDB and Oracle -** <br/>Added incremental synchronisation support for MongoDB and Oracle sources. This adds changeâ€‘only replication for both the sources so OLake transfers new/updated documents since the last run, reducing latency and data volume for recurring pipelines.

2. **Oracle Connector Filter & Chunking -** <br/>Added filter support and optimised chunking strategy for the Oracle connector. This ensures query-level filtering and an optimized chunking strategy to the Oracle connector, ensuring only relevant rows are fetched and evenly sized data chunks maximize parallel throughput.

3. **Oracle multi cursor support for incremental Sync -** <br/>OLake incremental sync can now be configured with a primary and secondary cursor column of the same datatype, where the secondary is used only if the primary cursor value is NULL, reducing missed changes in sparse or nullâ€‘heavy tables.

4. **MySQL Binlog Permissions Check -** <br/>Automatically validates that the MySQL user has the required binlog privileges before CDC starts, preventing midâ€‘run failures due to missing permissions.

5. **Postgres CDC Improvement -** <br/>The core improvement ensures that when Postgres CDC detects an LSN position problem requiring a full reload, it properly repositions the replication slot rather than attempting to read from outdated cached WAL data.

6. **Universal Filter Option -** <br/>Offers a consistent filter parameter across all source drivers, letting you apply the same include/exclude rules in MongoDB, Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, and more without driver-specific syntax.

### Destinations

1. **Clear Destination Flag -** <br/>Provides a flag to clear destination datasets before a full refresh, ensuring the target only contains the latest snapshot. This is useful when resetting tables or removing stale records ahead of a new load.

2. **Added support for custom s3_endpoint in Parquet writer config -** <br/>Added an optional s3_endpoint configuration in the Parquet writer allowing users to specify a custom S3-compatible endpoint for writing Parquet files to S3.

## ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes & Stability

1. **Credential Parsing Fix -** <br/>Corrects parsing of complex connection strings for Postgres and MongoDB so special characters and URI parameters are handled reliably. This reduces connection errors during job setup and discovery.

2. **Discovery Cursor Fix -** <br/>Fixes merging of cursor fields in the new discover flow so schema and cursor metadata are recorded consistently. This avoids missing or duplicated cursor information when building stream definitions.

3. **Postgres CDC Reliability -** <br/>Improved Postgres CDC behaviour by advancing LSN during full load when cache is invalid.
