## ðŸŽ¯ What's New

### Destinations

1. **Preserve Custom Destination DB for New Streams in Merge -** <br/>Detects user-provided custom database names or prefixes from the old catalog and applies the same custom DB or prefix to newly discovered streams during merge. Falls back to default naming only if no customization exists, and flattens nested if/else logic for cleaner, more readable code.

## ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes & Stability

1. **MySQL Empty Tables Sync Fix -** <br/>Fixed MySQL driver sync failure for tables containing 0 records by distinguishing between empty tables (which should succeed) and tables with missing statistics (which should fail). Previously, empty tables were incorrectly treated the same as tables with missing statistics.

2. **MongoDB Multiple _id Types Fallback Fix -** <br/>Fixed MongoDB sync failure when collections contain multiple _id types by adding a check to correctly fall back to bucket auto strategy instead of attempting the split vector strategy which would fail.
