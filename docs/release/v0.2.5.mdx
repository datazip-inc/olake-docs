# OLake (v0.2.5)
September 20 â€“ September 26, 2025

## ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes & Stability

1. **gRPC port binding retry mechanism -** <br/>Added backoff retry mechanism to resolve intermittent java.io.IOException: Failed to bind to address 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:50080 errors when creating the Iceberg writer gRPC server. This fix addresses port binding conflicts that occur when the port remains occupied during golang dialTimeout operations, improving connection reliability and reducing startup failures.

2. **MySQL CDC binlog position tracking -** <br/>Enhanced state cursor handling for MySQL CDC sync to include both start and end binlog positions, ensuring the cursor captures the full range of positions.

3. **MongoDB CDC for Sharded Clusters -** <br/>Enhanced PBRT (Post-Batch Resume Token) handling to resolve resume token inconsistencies across shards. This update ensures that after a failover or shard migration, CDC resume tokens are correctly retrieved and applied for each shardâ€™s stream, preventing data gaps or duplicate event processing when resuming change streams.

4. **MongoDB _id Multiple Types Detection Fix -** <br/> Fixed sync failures in collections where the _id field exists in more than one data type. OLake now accurately detects each _id type and applies a unified handling approach to prevent type mismatch errors during synchronization.
