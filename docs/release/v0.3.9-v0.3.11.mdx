# OLake (v0.3.9 - v0.3.11)
December 29, 2025 – January 5, 2026

## 🎯 What's New

### Platform Features

1. **Spark + Iceberg playground setup -** <br/>Added a Spark and Iceberg playground with a Jupyter notebook, full Docker Compose setup, and configuration/docs so users can quickly spin up an environment and run interactive data analysis.​

## 🔧 Bug Fixes & Stability

1. **MySQL CDC timestamp precision update -** <br/>Updated the `_cdc_timestamp` value for MySQL to store time with millisecond precision for more accurate change tracking.

2. **MySQL CDC ENUM update handling -** <br/> Fixed MySQL CDC update events for ENUM columns by resolving int64 enum index values from the binlog to their actual ENUM strings before writing them into Parquet.

3. **Kafka topic schema discovery fix -** <br/> Fixed Kafka topic-to-streams schema discovery to produce streams with correct data types.

4. **Parquet file naming for proper sorting -** <br/> Updated Parquet file naming convention to use zero-padded date and time components so files sort correctly by timestamp, for e.g., previous = `2026-1-3_8-27-56_01KE1FGTKPFDMN79ZN9P47KYY0.parquet` and current = `2026-01-03_08-26-26_01KE1FE28V82MCTY1M02DBM3G7.parquet`.

5. **Catalog default streams tracking -** <br/>Added a `default_streams` property to the catalog type to record all streams discovered initially, providing a clear baseline list for stream selection and management.
