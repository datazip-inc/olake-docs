# OLake (v0.3.14 - v0.3.16)
January 13, 2026 – February 09, 2026

## 🎯 What's New

### Sources

1. **New Source Introduction -** <br/>Introduced MSSQL as new source connector for OLake.

2. **New Source Introduction -** <br/>Introduced DB2 LUW as new source connector for OLake.

3. **MySQL connector JDBC params and SSL support -** <br/> Added support for JDBC URL parameters and SSL/TLS configuration in the MySQL connector, enabling more flexible and secure connections.

4. **Kafka Avro schema registry support  -** <br/> Added Schema Registry support for Kafka sync for Avro data using the Schema Registry API (currently Confluent Schema Registry); requires Confluent Wire Format, otherwise falls back to JSON.

### Platform Features

1. **OLake full refresh sync performance -**<br/> Improved OLake sync performance for full refresh operations.

2. **Manual approval for integration tests -** <br/> Added a manual approval gate for integration tests so they only run when explicitly approved.

3. **OLake version in telemetry -** <br/> Added OLake version as a telemetry property so it’s visible in the Mixpanel dashboard for filtering and analysis.

### Destinations

1. **Dedup handled by Iceberg Java engine -** <br/> Removed Go-side de-duplication logic since the Iceberg Java writer already handles row-level changes via positional delete files.

2. **Driver-specific CDC ordering metadata columns -** <br/> Added driver-specific CDC position columns (MySQL binlog file/pos, PostgreSQL LSN, MongoDB resume token, MSSQL start LSN/seq) so events can be reliably ordered even when `_cdc_timestamp` is identical within a transaction, and emit them consistently in both normalized and non-normalized outputs.

## 🔧 Bug Fixes & Stability

1. **Dynamic RPS benchmarking -** <br/>Improved performance tests to compare requests-per-second (RPS) against the average of the last 5 runs instead of static benchmarks for more reliable performance tracking.

2. **Parquet schema field name normalization -** <br/> Normalized schema field names to lowercase before Parquet schema creation so mixed-case definitions like `COL_INTEGER` and `col_integer` map deterministically to a single destination column, preventing non-deterministic type overrides and intermittent Parquet write failures during schema evolution.

3. **compare.go unit test coverage -** <br/> Added unit tests for `olake/utils/typeutils/compare.go`, covering comparisons across nil, signed/unsigned integers, floats, booleans, time.Time, custom time types, and fallback string comparisons to harden core comparison logic used in incremental sync, backfill, and binlog processing.

4. **MongoDB connection extra parameters -** <br/> Allowed passing arbitrary key–value connection options via the MongoDB config so they are appended to the MongoDB URI as additional parameters.

5. **Iceberg dedup commit ordering fix -** <br/> Updated the Iceberg writer to commit each writer completion’s data files and equality delete files together in a single atomic commit, preserving Iceberg sequence-number semantics so deletes apply to the intended data files and preventing duplicate results during schema evolution + concurrent updates.

6. **Arrow Iceberg writer improvements -** <br/> Added support for `now()` in partition transformations, fixed int-to-long handling in the Arrow Iceberg writer, and added integration tests.

7. **New writer instance on retry -** <br/> On retry, the writer now starts with a fresh instance and new artifacts instead of reusing the previous failed writer state, preventing unexpected failures and avoiding stale/partial data from being pushed after a retry.

8. **Kafka flatten json.Number handling -** <br/> Updated `flatten.go` to treat `json.Number` as a supported primitive type so numeric values decoded with `UseNumber()` pass through as numbers (not JSON strings), preventing schema detection type mismatches for Kafka JSON messages.

9. **MySQL binlog FLOAT precision alignment -** <br/> Ensured FLOAT values read from MySQL binlog follow MySQL’s float32 semantics by casting binlog float values back to float32, preventing extra-precision float64 output mismatches versus MySQL `SELECT` results.

10. **IBM Db2 LUW integration tests -** <br/> Added integration tests for IBM Db2 LUW to improve end-to-end validation.

​11. **MSSQL CDC capture instance selection for schema evolution -** <br/> With schema changes, CDC may create a new capture instance and streaming could keep reading from an older one. Fix: Always pick the newest valid capture instance (based on `start_lsn` vs `fromLSN`) and clamp reads to the new instance’s `start_lsn` when switching.

12. **MySQL CDC TIMESTAMP timezone alignment -** <br/> Resolve the effective MySQL timezone (session → global → system, or jdbc_url_params.time_zone) and use it in the CDC binlog syncer so CDC writes TIMESTAMP in the DB/server timezone.
