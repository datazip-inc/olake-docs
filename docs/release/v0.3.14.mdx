# OLake (v0.3.14 - v0.3.15)
January 13, 2026 – January 20, 2026

## 🎯 What's New

### Sources

1. **New Source Introduction -** <br/>Introduced MSSQL as new source connector for OLake.

2. **New Source Introduction -** <br/>Introduced DB2 LUW as new source connector for OLake.

### Platform Features

1. **OLake full refresh sync performance -**<br/> Improved OLake sync performance for full refresh operations.

### Destinations

1. **Dedup handled by Iceberg Java engine -** <br/> Removed Go-side de-duplication logic since the Iceberg Java writer already handles row-level changes via positional delete files.

## 🔧 Bug Fixes & Stability

1. **Dynamic RPS benchmarking -** <br/>Improved performance tests to compare requests-per-second (RPS) against the average of the last 5 runs instead of static benchmarks for more reliable performance tracking.

2. **Parquet schema field name normalization -** <br/> Normalized schema field names to lowercase before Parquet schema creation so mixed-case definitions like `COL_INTEGER` and `col_integer` map deterministically to a single destination column, preventing non-deterministic type overrides and intermittent Parquet write failures during schema evolution.

3. **cgo dependency removal for non-DB2 drivers -** <br/> Removed unnecessary cgo usage from Docker builds for all drivers except DB2 to avoid runtime cgo segmentation faults during multi-arch releases, and increased the GitHub Actions runner size to `32-ubuntu` for more reliable builds.

4. **compare.go unit test coverage -** <br/> Added unit tests for `olake/utils/typeutils/compare.go`, covering comparisons across nil, signed/unsigned integers, floats, booleans, time.Time, custom time types, and fallback string comparisons to harden core comparison logic used in incremental sync, backfill, and binlog processing.

5. **MongoDB connection extra parameters -** <br/> Allowed passing arbitrary key–value connection options via the MongoDB config so they are appended to the MongoDB URI as additional parameters.
