# OLake (v0.2.10 - v0.3.3)
October 31 – November 17, 2025

## 🎯 What's New

### Sources

1. **New Source Introduction -** <br/>Introduced Kafka as new source connector for OLake.

## 🔧 Bug Fixes & Stability

1. **Clear destination S3 Parquet path handling -** <br/>Fixed S3 Parquet path trimming in clear destination operations to properly handle whitespace in provided paths.

2. **Increase Iceberg commit timeout -** <br/>Extended Iceberg commit and write request timeout from 300s to 3600s to improve reliability for large data batches.

3. **Clear destination stream cleanup fix -** <br/>Corrected destination database checks so the streams are correctly detected and dropped during clear destination, ensuring complete cleanup.

4. **Kafka consumer balancing -** <br/>Updated balancer to assign consumer readers only to partitions with available data, preventing idle consumers from blocking on empty partitions and eliminating indefinite fetch waits until context cancellation.

5. **LSN acknowledgment fix -** <br/>Added a loop that repeatedly checks for the confirmed LSN to move forward, and stops after 5 minutes if it doesn’t, preventing hangs and making the process fail-safe.

6. **Clear Destination Global State reset -** <br/>When all persisted streams are dropped, mark the global state as nil; fail the sync on LSN mismatch; and fail incremental syncs when primary and secondary state remain nil throughout, preventing backfill-driven duplication.

7. **Global State nil Check -** <br/>Perform the empty-streams check only when global state is non-nil.
