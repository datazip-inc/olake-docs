# OLake (v0.2.0 â€“ v0.2.1)
August 15 â€“ August 27, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ What's New

### Sources

1. **Spec commands for Drivers and Destinations -** <br/>The spec command outputs a machine-readable JSON schema describing the configuration options and requirements for each OLake driver (source or destination).

2. **Implemented Namespace feature: Database, Table and Column names with Normalization -** <br/>Introduces Namespace Normalization that standardizes database, table, and column identifiers to a consistent, engineâ€‘safe format, and adds a --job-name flag thatâ€™s incorporated during normalization to generate unique database names per job, preventing collisions across environments and making downstream querying predictable.

### Destinations

1. **Destination Refactor -** <br/>Refactored the OLake destination writer components, this includes a major overhaul of the Java writer code, a refactor of the Go side of the writer pipeline, and optimization of the protobuf record structure to improve serialization efficiency and resource usage.

## ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes & Stability

1. **Environment not passed to Iceberg; JAR breaking IRSA in Kubernetes -** <br/>This fix ensures that critical AWS IRSA environment variables (`AWS_ROLE_ARN`, `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`) and related JVM options (`JAVA_TOOL_OPTS`) are correctly passed to the Iceberg writerâ€™s child process.

2. **MongoDB Integration Test -** <br/>Updated the MongoDB integration tests to use a larger test runner (32GB memory) enabling all driversâ€™ tests to run in parallel reliably. This improved test stability and reduced flaky failures during multi-driver parallel execution.

3. **Type conversion in Icerberg data types -** <br/>Added type hierarchy checks in Iceberg type conversions to ensure compatibility and correctness during schema evolution and data writes.

4. **Removed Segment dependency; telemetry events now sent directly to Mixpanel -** <br/>Updated OLake to send telemetry events directly to Mixpanel, removing the previous dependency on Segment.

5. **Respect --state flag when writing OLake sync state to file -** <br/>Corrected OLake behavior where specifying `--state /path/to/file.json` now ensures the sync state is both read from and written to the specified file path, instead of incorrectly writing only to `<config_folder>/state.json`.

6. **gRPC auto code dependency error -** <br/>Resolved gRPC autoâ€‘code dependency error by reverting the gRPC version on the Java side and regenerating RPC stubs with protoc 21, restoring sync compatibility.
