# OLake (v0.3.17)
February 10, 2026 – February 16, 2026

## 🎯 What's New

### Sources

1. **Kafka Avro schema normalization -** <br/>Avro decoding could fail when the schema `name` / `namespace` contained invalid characters (for example, `-`). Fixed this by replacing unsupported characters with `_` so schemas follow Avro naming conventions and can be decoded.

### Catalogs

1. **Glue catalog custom endpoint and credentials -** <br/> Added optional `glue_*` configs (endpoint, creds, catalog ID) so Glue catalog access can use separate credentials/endpoint from S3, while keeping default behavior unchanged when not set.

### Destinations

1. **Lakekeeper catalog image tag to v0.11.1 -** <br/> Replaced the `latest` Lakekeeper/catalog image tag with `v0.11.1`.

## 🔧 Bug Fixes & Stability

1. **Parquet schema extra column fix for normalization -** <br/> With normalization enabled, Parquet output incorrectly included an extra data column. Fixed this by initializing default OLake columns upfront and only add data when normalization is disabled.

2. **Primary key order fix for chunk processing (MSSQL, DB2) -** <br/> Fixed non-deterministic composite primary key ordering during backfill by sorting primary key columns in `ChunkIterator`, ensuring consistent chunk comparisons and scanning.

3. **MySQL timezone offset parsing fix -** <br/> Fixed MySQL timezone offsets not being parsed and falling back to UTC by correctly parsing offsets and using them for timezone conversion, so CDC/full refresh use the right timezone
