# Release Notes

Welcome to the OLake release notes archive. Each release contains a changelog of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. Use this landing page to:
- Quickly navigate to a specific versionâ€™s release notes
- Understand when major features were introduced
- Learn about backward-incompatible changes and deprecations

**Why a Release Landing Page?** OLake evolves rapidly with new connectors, performance improvements, and stability enhancements. Since not all features are available in every version, this page helps you identify when key features were introduced, track deprecations, and access guidance for migrating between versions.

### Navigate Releases

Use the Release dropdown in the documentation sidebar to select any versionâ€™s detailed notes. Each version page includes:
- ðŸŽ¯ What's New: Additions or enhancements introduced in this release across Sources, Destinations, Catalogs, or core Platform features; typically new connectors, capabilities, flags, or behavior that expand OLakeâ€™s functionality.
- ðŸ”§ Bug Fixes & Stability: Improvements and refinements to existing functionality in this release; reliability, performance, and compatibility fixes (e.g., retries, state handling, type conversions, dependency updates).
