# Overview

OLake jobs are a way to run OLake processes like sync, discover, and others in a controlled manner. They allow you to schedule and manage these processes efficiently.

A job in OLake is a single pipeline that defines how data should be synchronized from a **source** to a **destination**. It includes details such as the source and destination configurations, the streams to be synchronized, the replication frequency and other related job configurations.

There are 4 types of associated jobs, depending on the job status:
1. **Active Jobs**: These jobs are currently running or scheduled to run. They are visible in the "Active Jobs" section of the OLake UI.
2. **Inactive Jobs**: These jobs are not currently running but can be resumed. They are visible in the "Inactive Jobs" section of the OLake UI.
3. **Saved Jobs**: These jobs are saved configurations that can be used to create new job runs. They are visible in the "Saved Jobs" section of the OLake UI.
4. **Failed Jobs**: These jobs have encountered errors during execution. They are visible in the "Failed Jobs" section of the OLake UI.

OLake jobs can be created, edited, and managed through the OLake UI. You can also view job history, logs, and other details to monitor the progress and status of your jobs.

## Key Features
- **Job Creation**: Easily create jobs with source and destination configurations.
- **Job Management**: Start, pause, resume, and delete jobs as needed.
- **Job Monitoring**: View job history, logs, and status to track job progress.
- **Job Scheduling**: Set up jobs to run at specific intervals or on-demand.
- **Job Configuration**: Customize job settings such as replication frequency, job name, and more.

## Things to Note:
1. An active and failed job will be shown in both the "Active Jobs" and "Failed Jobs" sections.
2. An inactive only job will be shown in the "Inactive Jobs" section.
3. A saved only job will be shown in the "Saved Jobs" section.

## Saved Jobs
Saved jobs are configurations that can be reused to create new job runs. They allow you to save time by not having to reconfigure the same job settings repeatedly. You can create a saved job from an active or inactive job, and it will be stored in the "Saved Jobs" section of the OLake UI.

## Logs
Logs are essential for debugging and monitoring the execution of OLake jobs. You can view logs for each job run to understand what happened during the execution, including any errors or warnings that may have occurred.

To view a job log:
1. Click on the "Job History" button for the job you want to inspect.
2. Select the specific job run you want to view logs for.
3. Click on the "View Logs" button to see the detailed logs for that job run.
