# Overview

A job in OLake is a single pipeline that defines how data should be synchronized from a **source** to a **destination**. It includes details such as the source and destination configurations, the streams to be synchronized, the replication frequency and other related job configurations.

There are 4 types of associated jobs, depending on the job status:
1. **Active Jobs**: These jobs are currently running or scheduled to run. Any newly created job will also appear on the Active tab. They are visible in the "Active Jobs" section of the OLake UI.
2. **Inactive Jobs**: These jobs are not currently running but can be resumed. A paused job will also be under Inactive Jobs tab. They are visible in the "Inactive Jobs" section of the OLake UI.
3. **Saved Jobs**: These jobs are saved configurations that can be used to create new job runs. A saved job when scheduled or run will appear under the Active Jobs tab. They are visible in the "Saved Jobs" section of the OLake UI.

4. **Failed Jobs**: These jobs have encountered errors during execution or failed sync execution. They are visible in the "Failed Jobs" section of the OLake UI.



OLake jobs can be created, edited, and managed through the OLake UI. You can also view complete job history, detailed logs for each job run, and other details to monitor the progress and status of your jobs.
