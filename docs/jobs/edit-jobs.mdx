# Edit Jobs

There are a number of things you can do with OLake jobs. You can edit:
1. Start the data sync
2. Pause the job
3. Check the job history (and then see job logs to debug incase the sync fails)
4. Job Settings
5. Delete the job

Lets start by explaining how to edit a job.

### 1. Start the Data Sync
To start the data sync, click on the "Start Sync" button. This will initiate the data synchronization process based on the configurations you have set up in the job.

### 2. Pause the Job

To pause the job, click on the "Pause Job" button. This will temporarily halt the data synchronization process. You can resume the job later by clicking on the "Resume Job" button. 

Once you pause the job, the job will move to `Inactive Jobs` section in the Jobs interface. You can resume the job by clicking on the "Resume Job" button.

### 3. Edit Job Settings

To edit the job settings, click on the "Edit Job" button. This will allow you to modify the job configurations such as source and destination settings, stream selection, and job configuration options. Basically you can edit the entire flow of the job that you have created.

### 4. Check Job History

To check the job history, click on the "Job History" button. This will show you a list of all the previous runs of the job, including their status (success or failure), start time, end time, and duration. You can also view detailed logs for each run to debug any issues that may have occurred during the synchronization process.

### 5. Job Settings

To edit the job settings, click on the "Job Settings" button. This will allow you to modify the job configurations such as:

1. Job Name: Change the name of the job.
2. Replication Frequency: Change how often the job runs.
3. Replication Frequency Value: Change the value for the replication frequency.
4. Pause Job: A toggle to temporarily halt the data synchronization process.
5. Clear destination and sync: It will delete all the data in the destination and then sync the data from the source to the destination. This is useful if you want to start fresh with the data in the destination.

6. Delete the job: No data will be deleted in your source and destination, but the job will be deleted from the list of active jobs. The source and destination configurations will remain intact but will be moved to `Inactive sources / destination` section if there are no other jobs that are associated with these source or destination, and you can create a new job with the same configurations later if needed.

This is useful if you want to remove a job that is no longer needed.

There are two ways to delete a job:

1. **From the Job Section**: Click on the 3 dots in the actions column and select "Delete" button.
2. **From Job Settings**: Click on the "Delete Job" button at the bottom of the job settings page.
