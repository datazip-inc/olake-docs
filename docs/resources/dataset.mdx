You can use the following GitHub repository [awesome-json-datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets?tab=readme-ov-file) to get some sample JSON data for testing out OLake. OR just use [this data](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny.json).

Our MongoDB benchmarks are based on Twitter dataset - [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam-twitter-stream-2017-11) (This JSON dataset has 4 levels of complex nesting, 230 million rows (664.81GB) uncompressed).


For SQL datasets, you can generate one using TPC, click [here](https://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/current_specifications5.asp) and download the TPC-H tool and [this guide](https://gist.github.com/yunpengn/6220ffc1b69cee5c861d93754e759d08) to generate the sample dataset however much you wish to generate and load data into PostgreSQL or MySQL.
