## 1. Source

A Source is the system from which OLake reads data. This could be a database (MongoDB, Postgres, MySQL, Oracle), basically a data service. When you create a source in OLake, you are telling the platform where the data should come from.

### Active Source
A source becomes active once it is linked to at least one job. This means OLake is actively pulling data from this source and sending it to a destination. They are visible in the "Active Sources" section of the OLake UI.

### Inactive Source
A source is inactive when it has been created in OLake but is not yet assigned to any job. It exists in the system, but no data is being read from it until a job is created. They are visible in the "Inactive Sources" section of the OLake UI.

## 2. Destination

A Destination is the system where OLake writes data after it has been extracted from a source. In OLake, destinations define where your data will be stored and in what format. Currently, OLake supports two types of destinations: Amazon S3 and Apache Iceberg.

### Active Destination
A destination is active when it is assigned to at least one job. This means OLake is currently delivering data into this destination. They are visible in the "Active Destinations" section of the OLake UI.

### Inactive Destination
A destination is inactive when it has been created in OLake but is not linked to any job. It is available for use but will not receive any data until a job is configured. They are visible in the "Inactive Destinations" section of the OLake UI.

## 3. Jobs

A Job is the pipeline or process in OLake that moves data from a source to a destination. A job defines what data is moved, how it is moved (full refresh, incremental, CDC), and where it is delivered. Jobs are the central element of OLake, as they connect sources and destinations.

### Active Job
A job is active when it is running or scheduled to run. This means OLake is currently transferring data according to the job's configuration. Any newly created job will also appear on the "Active Jobs" section of the OLake UI.

### Inactive Job
A job is inactive when it has been paused. No data transfer takes place until it is resumed, but all configurations and previous states are preserved. They are visible in the "Inactive Jobs" section of the OLake UI.

### Saved Job
These jobs are saved configurations that can be used to create new job runs. A saved job when scheduled or run will appear under the Active Jobs tab. They are visible in the "Saved Jobs" section of the OLake UI.

### Failed Job
A job is failed when OLake encounters an error during execution (such as network issues, schema conflicts, or permission problems). Failed jobs require troubleshooting to identify the reason that led to the failure of the job. They are visible in the "Failed Jobs" section of the OLake UI.

## 4. Streams

A Stream in OLake represents a unit of data (such as a table or collection) discovered from a source. This panel lets you choose which streams to sync, how the data is synced (i.e. you can choose from different sync modes), what schemas they use, and also allows the user to do partitioning on data before loading it into the destination.
