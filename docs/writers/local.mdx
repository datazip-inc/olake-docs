# Parquet local writer
Parquet local writer is live, checkout the [README section here.](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/blob/master/README.md)

:::info
Please read the [getting started](../getting-started) instructions before proceeding with this section.

```json title="olake_folder/writer.json"
{
  "type": "PARQUET",
  "writer": {
    "normalization": false,
    "local_path": "/mnt/config"
  }
}
```

- **`type`**: The output file format (e.g., `PARQUET`).
- **`writer.normalization`**: If `true`, OLake applies level-1 JSON flattening to nested objects.
- **`writer.local_path`**: Local directory **inside** the Docker container. We map this path to your host file system via a Docker volume.

## Data Partitioning
