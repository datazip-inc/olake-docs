# `writer.json`

OLake supports two writer modes for exporting your database data in Parquet format:

1. Local Parquet Writer
2. S3 Writer
3. Iceberg Writer (coming soon)

Before proceeding with either configuration, please ensure you have completed the [getting started](../category/getting-started) instructions. For more background details, refer to the [README section](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/blob/master/README.md).

##  Data Partitioning

While not directly configured in `writer.json`, data partitioning is an important aspect of how your data is organized when written to storage. For more details on partitioning strategies (especially when using S3), please refer to the [S3 partitioning documentation](./s3/partitioning).


## Upcoming Features: Iceberg Writer

The Iceberg writer is an upcoming feature, expected to be released by the end of February 2025. Stay tuned for updates and further documentation on its configuration and usage.



If you have any further questions or need additional support, please refer to the [getting started](../category/getting-started) section or the [OLake README](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/blob/master/README.md).
