# Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Writer Overview

OLake supports writing data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), with any [Catalog](../catalog/overview) that supports Iceberg. This allows you to leverage GCS as a scalable and durable storage solution for your data lakehouse architecture.

Refer - https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/hmackeys

More details on how to configure and use the GCS writer will be available soon. In the meantime, you can refer to the [Iceberg writer documentation](../iceberg/overview) for general guidance on Iceberg integration, as the principles are similar across different storage backends.
