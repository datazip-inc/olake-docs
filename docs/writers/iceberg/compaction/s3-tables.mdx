# S3 Tables 

OLake supports S3 table (as REST catalog destination) bucket with AWS signing V4.

More details on how to configure and use the S3 writer will be available soon. In the meantime, you can refer to the [Iceberg writer documentation](../iceberg/overview) for general guidance on Iceberg integration, as the principles are similar across different storage backends.
