<MinioJDBCIcebergWriterConfigLocalDetails/>

You can query the data via:

<CatalogQuery/>

If you are build olake locally (using `./build.sh` command), change the config to:
1. `jdbc_url": "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/iceberg"`
2. `s3_endpoint": "http://localhost:9000"`

For S3 related permissions which is needed to write data to S3, refer to the [AWS S3 Permissions](../../s3/overview#iam-permissions-required) documentation.

:::info
If you wish to test out the REST Catalog locally, you can use the [docker-compose](../../writers/iceberg/docker-compose) setup. The local test setup uses Minio as an S3-compatible storage and other all [supported catalog types](../docker-compose#local-catalog--test-setup). 

You can then setup local spark to run queries on the iceberg tables created in the local test setup.
