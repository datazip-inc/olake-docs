### Using Lakekeeper
Lakekeeper is a service that provides a unified view of all your data lakes, regardless of their location. It allows you to manage and monitor your data lakes from a single interface, making it easier to keep track of your data and ensure its integrity.

We have provided a sample configuration for Lakekeeper, which can be used to set up the service in your environment. This configuration includes all the necessary parameters and settings to get started with Lakekeeper. Refer [here](../docker-compose)

After you have set up Lakekeeper using the docker compose provided, you can access the Lakekeeper UI at `http://localhost:8181/ui`.
