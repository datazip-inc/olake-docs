## REST Supported catalog types

### Using Lakekeeper
Lakekeeper is a service that provides a unified view of all your data lakes, regardless of their location. It allows you to manage and monitor your data lakes from a single interface, making it easier to keep track of your data and ensure its integrity.

We have provided a sample configuration for Lakekeeper, which can be used to set up the service in your environment. This configuration includes all the necessary parameters and settings to get started with Lakekeeper. Reder [here](https://docs.lakekeeper.io/getting-started/) for more

After you have set up Lakekeeper using the docker compose provided, you can access the Lakekeeper UI at `http://localhost:8181/ui`.

### Steps to create a Warehouse in Lakekeeper

1. **Access the Warehouse Section:**
   - Navigate to the `Warehouse` section within Lakekeeper.

2. **Initiate Warehouse Creation:**
   - Click on the `Add Warehouse` button.

3. **Select the Storage Type:**
   - Choose `S3` as the storage option.

4. **Enter AWS Credentials:**
   - Provide the AWS Access Key ID as `admin`.
   - Provide the AWS Secret Access Key as `password`.

5. **Configure S3 Settings:**
   - Set the S3 Flavor to `S3 Compatible Storage`.
   - Enable the toggle for `Enable path style access`.
   - Enable the toggle for `Enable alternative s3 protocols`.

6. **Specify the Bucket Details:**
   - Enter the bucket name as `warehouse` (or the name of the bucket you created using MinIO).

7. **Configure the Endpoint:**
   - Provide the endpoint as `http:{IP of your machine}:9000`.  
   - To retrieve your machine's IP address, execute the command:
     ```
     ipconfig getifaddr en0
     ```

8. **Select the Bucket Region:**
   - Choose the appropriate region for your bucket.

Following these steps will successfully create a warehouse in Lakekeeper.

:::info
If you wish to test out the REST Catalog locally, you can use the [docker-compose](../docker-compose) setup. The local test setup uses Minio as an S3-compatible storage and other all [supported catalog types](../docker-compose#local-catalog--test-setup). 

You can then setup local spark to run queries on the iceberg tables created in the local test setup.
