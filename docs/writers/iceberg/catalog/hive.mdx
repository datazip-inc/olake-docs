## Hive Catalog

:::info
Use `iceberg_s3_path` with `s3a` prefix if your Hive is configured so. This will work for most use cases. Otherwise, use `iceberg_path` with `s3` prefix.
:::

<HiveIcebergWriterConfig/>

### Hive Configuration Parameters

<HiveIcebergWriterConfigDetails/>


You can query the data via:

<CatalogQuery/>

For S3 related permissions which is needed to write data to S3, refer to the [AWS S3 Permissions](../../s3/overview#iam-permissions-required) documentation.

:::info
If you wish to test out the REST Catalog locally, you can use the [docker-compose](../../writers/iceberg/docker-compose) setup. The local test setup uses Minio as an S3-compatible storage and other all [supported catalog types](../docker-compose#local-catalog--test-setup). 

You can then setup local spark to run queries on the iceberg tables created in the local test setup.
