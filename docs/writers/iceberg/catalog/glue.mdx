:::info
The above IAM policy is a sample policy that allows the OLake Glue Catalog to create and update tables in the Glue Catalog. You can modify the `Resource` section to match your specific Glue Catalog ARN. If you already have a database and table created in the Glue Catalog, you can use the `GetTable` and `GetDatabase` permissions to read the existing metadata and remove the `CreateDatabase` and `CreateTable` permissions. The `SearchTables` permission is optional and is used to search for tables in the Glue Catalog.
:::

For S3 related permissions which is needed to write data to S3, refer to the [AWS S3 Permissions](../../s3/overview#iam-permissions-required) documentation.


:::info
If you wish to test out the REST Catalog locally, you can use the [docker-compose](../docker-compose) setup. The local test setup uses Minio as an S3-compatible storage and other all [supported catalog types](../docker-compose#local-catalog--test-setup). 

You can then setup local spark to run queries on the iceberg tables created in the local test setup.
