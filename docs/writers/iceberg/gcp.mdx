# Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Writer Overview

Currently OLake supports writing data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), using [`Hive Catalog`](/docs/writers/iceberg/catalog/hive#gcp-dataproc-metastore) that supports Iceberg. This allows you to leverage GCS as a scalable and durable storage solution for your data lakehouse architecture.

More details on how to configure and use the GCS writer will be available soon. In the meantime, you can refer to the [Iceberg writer documentation](/docs/writers/iceberg/catalog/rest?rest-catalog=generic) for general guidance on Iceberg integration, as the principles are similar across different storage backends.
