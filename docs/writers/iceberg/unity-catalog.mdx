# Unity Catalog (Databricks)

OLake supports Databricks Unity Catalog as a REST catalog destination with token-based or OAuth2 authentication.

## Important Limitations

⚠️ **Current Unity Catalog Limitations:**
- **Append Only**: At the time of creation of this documentation, Unity Catalog only supports **Append operations** (NO updates) for Iceberg writes
- **Managed Tables**: Unity Catalog supports Iceberg writes only in its own managed Iceberg tables
- **OAuth2 Status**: Currently, Personal Access Token authentication has been tested and works well. OAuth2 is available as an alternative but is experiencing issues (receiving internal server errors from Databricks during testing)

For more details on Unity Catalog Iceberg support, refer to the [official Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/iceberg/).

This documentation is primarily focused on creating tokens for ingesting data into Unity/Databricks managed Iceberg tables using OLake.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to Databricks workspace
- Access to AWS S3 bucket (if using AWS for external storage)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a New User & Token

#### Create the User

It is recommended to create a new user instead of using an existing one for security purposes.

1. Go to top right corner user section → **Settings** → **Identity and Access** → **Users (Manage)**
2. Add a new user with email address
3. Go to **Settings** → **Advanced** → **Access Control**
4. Turn on **Personal Access Tokens** if it's not already enabled
   
   ![Personal Access Tokens Settings](/img/docs/iceberg/catalog/unity/unity-catalog-personal-access-tokens.png)

5. Go to **Permissions** and add the new user to allow token generation

#### Create the Token

1. Login with the new user credentials
2. Go to **Settings** → **Developer** → **Access Tokens** → **Manage**
3. Create a new token and set the appropriate validity period
4. Copy and save the token immediately (it's only visible once)

### Step 2: Create External Location for Data Storage

1. Create a new external location as Unity Catalog Iceberg requires S3-based external storage (when using AWS).
   
   Navigate to the Catalog section and click on "Create an external location":
   
   ![Create External Location](/img/docs/iceberg/catalog/unity/unity-catalog-grant-permissions.png)

2. Follow the recommended Databricks guide to add S3 bucket storage quickly and securely.

### Step 3: Create Schema with Proper Permissions

1. Create a new schema using the storage location created in Step 2
   
   ![Create New Schema Dialog](/img/docs/iceberg/catalog/unity/unity-catalog-create-external-location.png)

2. Go to **Schema** → **Permissions**
3. Grant the following permissions to the newly created user:
   - `ALL PRIVILEGES`
   - `EXTERNAL USE SCHEMA`
   - `MANAGE`

## Configuration

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="unity-ui" label="OLake UI" default>

Unity Catalog supports two authentication methods: **Token-based** (recommended) and **OAuth2** (alternative).

### Common Configuration Fields

These fields are required for both authentication methods:

| Parameter | Sample Value | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **REST Catalog URL** | `https://adb-123456789.databricks.com/api/2.1/unity-catalog/iceberg-rest` | Databricks workspace URL with Unity Catalog REST API endpoint. Use your actual workspace URL. |
| **Iceberg S3 Path (Warehouse)** | `workspace` | Name of the catalog in Unity Catalog (e.g., "workspace", "main"). This appears as `iceberg_s3_path` in JSON config. |
| **Iceberg Database** | `default` | Namespace name inside the catalog (e.g., "default", "production"). This appears as `iceberg_db` in JSON config. |
| **Normalization** | `true` | Enable data normalization for proper formatting in Unity Catalog. Recommended to keep enabled. |
| **No Identifier Fields** | `true` | Required for Unity Catalog managed Iceberg tables that don't support equality delete-based updates. Must be enabled. |

### Token-Based Authentication (Recommended)

**✅ This method has been thoroughly tested and confirmed working**

Additional field required for token-based authentication:

| Parameter | Sample Value | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Token** | `dapi1234567890abcdef...` | Databricks Personal Access Token for authentication. Created in Settings > Developer > Access Tokens. |

### OAuth2 Authentication (Alternative)

⚠️ **Note**: OAuth2 authentication is currently experiencing issues with internal server errors from Databricks during testing.

Additional fields required for OAuth2 authentication:

| Parameter | Sample Value | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **REST Auth Type** | `oauth2` | Set authentication type to OAuth2 |
| **OAuth2 URI** | `https://adb-123456789.databricks.com/oidc/v1/token` | OAuth2 server URI for your Databricks workspace |
| **Credential** | `client_id:client_secret` | Client ID and secret in format "id:secret" |
| **Scope** | `sql offline_access` | OAuth2 scopes (space-separated) |

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="unity-cli" label="OLake CLI" default>

### JSON Configuration

Create a json for destination config (`destination.json`)

```json
{
  "type": "ICEBERG",
  "writer": {
    "catalog_type": "rest",
    "normalization": true,
    "rest_catalog_url": "https://<DATABRICK_WORKSPACE_URL>/api/2.1/unity-catalog/iceberg-rest",
    "iceberg_s3_path": "<CATALOG_NAME>",
    "iceberg_db": "<NAMESPACE>",
    "token": "<DATABRICK_USER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>",
    "no_identifier_fields": true
  }
}
```

### Configuration Key Details

Change the following placeholders in the above configuration with:

- `DATABRICK_WORKSPACE_URL` -> Databricks workspace URL (URL that you use to access your Databricks console)
- `CATALOG_NAME` -> Catalog name (e.g., "workspace")
- `NAMESPACE` -> Namespace name inside catalog (e.g., "default")
- `DATABRICK_USER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` -> Go to Settings > Developer > Create Personal Access Token
- `no_identifier_fields` -> Set to `true` (Required for environments that don't support equality delete-based updates, such as Databricks Unity managed Iceberg tables)

### OAuth2 Authentication (Alternative - Currently Having Issues)

⚠️ **Note**: OAuth2 authentication is currently experiencing issues with internal server errors from Databricks during testing. Personal Access Token authentication is recommended until these issues are resolved.

You can attempt OAuth2 authentication by modifying the configuration:

```json
{
  "type": "ICEBERG",
  "writer": {
    "catalog_type": "rest",
    "normalization": true,
    "rest_catalog_url": "https://<DATABRICK_WORKSPACE_URL>/api/2.1/unity-catalog/iceberg-rest",
    "iceberg_s3_path": "<CATALOG_NAME>",
    "iceberg_db": "<NAMESPACE>",
    "rest_auth_type": "oauth2",
    "oauth2_uri": "<OAUTH2_SERVER_URI>",
    "credential": "<CLIENT_ID>:<CLIENT_SECRET>",
    "scope": "<OAUTH2_SCOPES>",
    "no_identifier_fields": true
  }
}
```

Additional OAuth2 fields:
- `rest_auth_type` -> Set to "oauth2"
- `oauth2_uri` -> OAuth2 server URI for your Databricks workspace
- `credential` -> Client ID and secret in format "id:secret"
- `scope` -> OAuth2 scopes (space-separated)

</TabItem>

</Tabs>



## Important Notes

- **Unity Catalog Compatibility**: The `no_identifier_fields: true` setting is crucial for Unity Catalog managed Iceberg tables as they don't support equality delete-based updates
- **Normalization**: Set `normalization: true` to ensure proper data formatting for Unity Catalog
- **REST API**: Unity Catalog uses Iceberg's REST catalog API for table operations
- **Permissions**: Ensure your user or service principal has appropriate permissions on the target catalog and schema

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**: Verify your Personal Access Token is valid and has the necessary permissions
2. **Catalog Not Found**: Ensure the catalog name exists in your Unity Catalog
3. **Schema Permissions**: Check that you have CREATE TABLE permissions on the target schema
4. **Network Access**: Verify your OLake instance can reach the Databricks workspace URL
