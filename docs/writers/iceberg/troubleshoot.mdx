# Troubleshooting Iceberg Writer

### 1. maven related issues
```
Iceberg JAR file not found. Building with Maven...
usage: mvn [-h] [_ ...]
mvn: error: unrecognized arguments: -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

#### Solution: 
Install the correct version of maven. Run `which mvn` or `mvn --version` to verify you have correct installation of Maven.


### 2. AWS region issues
```
Region must be specified either via environment variable (AWS_REGION) or  system property (aws.region)., software.amazon.awssdk.regions.providers.AwsProfileRegionProvider@7a7eb56e: No region provided in profile: default, software.amazon.awssdk.regions.providers.InstanceProfileRegionProvider@241d5e60: Unable to contact EC2 metadata service.
```


#### Solution
Although you should not see such issues, but in case you do, export a variable `export AWS_REGION=us-east-1` or any other region to resolve this.


### 3. Linkage error
```
025-04-02T13:51:25Z ERROR [Java-Iceberg:50051] Error: LinkageError occurred while loading main class io.debezium.server.iceberg.OlakeRpcServer
2025-04-02T13:51:25Z ERROR [Java-Iceberg:50051] 	java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: io/debezium/server/iceberg/OlakeRpcServer has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 61.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 55.0
```

#### Solution
Make sure your java version is **>17**. You can check your java version by running `java -version` in the terminal. If you have an older version, consider updating to a newer version of Java.

Reload your shell with `source ~/.zshrc` after updating the Java version.

### 4. gRPC Connection Fail
**Cause**: The gRPC server is not running or using an incorrect port. 
#### Solution
- Ensure the Java gRPC server is running.<br/>
- Verify that the port in `destination.json` matches the server's port. 

### 5. Data Not Appearing in Spark
**Cause**: Misconfiguration or delayed data propagation. 
#### Solution
- Double-check the `destination.json` configuration.<br/>
- Connect to the `spark-iceberg` container and run a Spark SQL query.

### 6. Docker Compose Issues
**Cause**: Docker or Docker Compose is not properly installed or services failed to start.
#### Solution
- Verify Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.
- Use `docker compose ps` to check service statuses.
