# Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Writer Overview

OLake supports writing data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) in plain parquet format. \
Add these HMAC keys as Access Key and Secret Key in the destination configuration - [Parquet Writer Configuration](./config)

More details on how to configure and use the GCS writer will be available soon. In the meantime, you can refer to the [Iceberg writer documentation](../iceberg/overview) for general guidance on Iceberg integration, as the principles are similar across different storage backends.
