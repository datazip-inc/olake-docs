## OLake vs AWS DMS Benchmark

This document summarizes measured performance, environment, and cost for migrating PostgreSQL data to Parquet Writer (AWS S3) using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) and OLake. 

## Workload

- **Dataset:** This benchmark uses two large tables from **NYC Taxi Data** `trips2` and `fhv_trips`
- **Total rows:** **4,008,587,913 rows** including both tables
- **Modes evaluated:** We are performing **Full Refresh** and **CDC** workload (50 million rows)

## Environment

- **Source database:** Azure PostgreSQL (32 vCores, 128 GB RAM)
- **Destination:** Amazon S3 (Parquet)
- **Migration compute:** c6i.16xlarge (64 vCPU, 128 GB RAM)
- **Reference compute price:** ~$3.07/hour

:::note
The **same dataset and compute** were used for both the tools.

## Full Refresh Results

The full‑load test measures time and throughput to copy the complete dataset from source PostgreSQL to Parquet files in S3, serving as a baseline for bulk data movement under sustained load.

| Tool   | Rows Processed | Total Time | Avg Throughput (rows/sec) |
| ------ | --------------: | ---------: | -------------------------: |
| OLake  | 4,008,587,913  | 1 h 59 m    | 558,765                  |
| AWS DMS| 4,008,587,913 | 9 h 8 m    | 122,000                   |

**Key observations:**

- **OLake** completed the workload **~4.6 x faster** as compared to **DMS** for Full Refresh.
- OLake does not require any manual partition-boundary scripting, whereas DMS required manual boundary generation to parallelize the load for PostgreSQL sources.

## CDC Results (Insert-only; 50M rows)

The CDC test measures sustained ingest of incremental changes from PostgreSQL into Parquet, validating plugin configuration, replication slots, and end‑to‑end apply throughput. We will be ingesting 25 million records for each of the tables `trips2` and `fhv_trips`. 

| Tool   | Rows Processed | Total Time | Avg Throughput (rows/sec) |
| ------ | --------------: | ---------: | -------------------------: |
| AWS DMS| 50,000,000      | 22 m 41 s  | 36,738                    |
| OLake  | 50,000,000      | 16 m 24 s  |  50,812                  |

**Key Observations:**

- **OLake** completed the workload **~1.38 × faster** as compared to **DMS** for CDC.
- OLake does not require any manual setup we simply had to select CDC option and that is it! Whereas DMS required enabling pglogical via Azure extensions, performing a complex pglogical setup, and specifying the starting LSN for replication tasks.

## Resource Utilization 

### 1. Full Refresh:

| Memory Stats | Olake | DMS |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| Min          | 1.04 GB | 20 GB |
| Max          | 46.72 GB | 40 GB |
| Mean         | 25.70 GB | 30 GB |

**Olake's** memory usage ranged from 2.12 GB to 46.72 GB, **averaging 25.70 GB** throughout the transfer. For **DMS**, the memory usage ranged from 20 GB to 40 GB, **averaging 30 GB** throughout the transfer.

### 2. Change Data Capture (CDC):

| Memory Stats | Olake | DMS |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| Min          | 20 MB |  |
| Max          | 6.1 GB |  |
| Mean         | 2.65 GB |  |

**Olake's** memory usage ranged from 20 MB to 6.1 GB, **averaging 2.65 GB** throughout the transfer. For **DMS**, the memory usage ranged from [] GB to [] GB, **averaging [] GB** throughout the transfer.

## Cost Comparison (Compute Only)

Compute costs scale linearly with runtime at a given instance class for both OLake and DMS. 

Here is the cost comparison for **Full Refresh** process.

| Scenario              | Instance         | Runtime  | Approx. Cost |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | -------: | -----------: |
| DMS Full Refresh      | c6i.16xlarge     | 9h 08m   | ~$28.03      |
| OLake Full Refresh    | c6i.16xlarge     | 1h 59m   | ~$6.08       |

**Important-** 

**OLake** is delivering **4.61x cost savings** as compared to **DMS** on compute alone. When you're moving terabytes monthly, those savings add up fast!

**Scaling Impact-**

Let us take a closer look at how the costs evolve over time for both the tools. 

Let us assume that we are moving the same dataset everyday **"just once"** for the below mentioned durations.


| Tool | 1 Month Cost | 2 Months Cost | 1 Year Cost |
|------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| DMS  | ~$840      | ~$1,681       | ~$5045     |
| OLake| ~$182      | ~$364      | ~$1094      |

It quickly becomes evident how the costs unfold over time for both tools, painting a rather unmistakable picture of which one is more cost-efficient.<br/>**And, just a gentle reminder:** You’re rarely content with a single sync per day—so brace yourself, the costs will only climb from here.

:::info[Point to Remember]

OLake is open source; there are no licensing fees. Actual spend depends on user infra and storage.

## Dataset and Table Schemas

The OLake benchmarks page publishes NYC Taxi table shapes that are appropriate for both bulk transfer and CDC scenarios at scale, which can be reused to maintain comparability across tools.

## Implementation Considerations

- DMS PostgreSQL full loads may require manual task mapping with partition boundaries to achieve higher parallelism.
- DMS CDC for Azure PostgreSQL required enabling `pglogical` via `azure.extensions` and configuring replication sets with aligned start LSN.
- OLake parallelization and schema handling are automatic; no manual boundary generation was required in this benchmark.
