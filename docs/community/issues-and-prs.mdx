## General Guidelines

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.


:::warning

- All contributions must target the OLake [staging branch](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/tree/staging). Create feature branches from staging and open PRs against staging.

:::

## Steps to raise a PR

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:datazip-inc/olake.git
```

### 2. Create a Pull Request

#### Make A Branch
- Please create a separate branch for each issue that you're working on. Always checkout the `staging` branch first, and create your feature/fix branch from there.

```bash
git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>
```

To check your current branch,

```bash
git branch
```

To get back to an existing branch

```bash
git checkout <EXISTING_BRANCH_NAME> 
```

or

```bash
git switch <EXISTING_BRANCH_NAME> 
```

### 3. Add, verify and push changes

#### 1. Run pre-commits (usually for checks and validations before commiting):

```bash
make pre-commit
```

#### 2. Add your changes

```bash
git add . 
```

#### 3. verify

Perform `git status` or `git diff` to see what all changes occured, which all files are ready to be committed (or staged)

#### 4. Commit your changes

After you are done with all the changes, perform

```bash
git commit -am "write a descriptive message here about the nature of changes / addition of code"
```

Next, take a pull (in case any new code has been added, this will help you avoid merge conflicts) by doing `git pull` and then `git push origin <YOUR_FEATURE_BRANCH_NAME>`.

**Push Your Code ASAP**
- Push your code as soon as you can. Follow the "early and often" rule.
- Make a pull request as soon as you can and mark the title with a "[WIP]". You can create a draft pull request.

**Describe Your Pull Request**
- Use the format specified in pull request template for the repository. Populate the pull request description completely for maximum verbosity.
  - Tag the actual issue number by replacing #[issue_number] e.g. #42. This closes the issue when your PR is merged.
  - Tag the actual issue author by replacing @[author] e.g. @issue_author. This brings the reporter of the issue into the conversation.
  - Mark the tasks off your checklist by adding an x in the [ ] e.g. [x]. This checks off the boxes in your to-do list. The more boxes you check, the better.
- Describe your change in detail. Too much detail is better than too little.
- Describe how you tested your change.
- Check the Preview tab to make sure the Markdown is correctly rendered and that all tags and references are linked. If not, go back and edit the Markdown.

### Request Review
- Once your PR is ready, remove the "[WIP]" from the title and/or change it from a draft PR to a regular PR.
- If a specific reviewer is not assigned automatically, please request a review from the project maintainer.

## Conventions to follow when submitting Commits and Pull Request(s).

We try to follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), more specifically the commits and PRs **should have type specifiers** prefixed in the name. [This](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) should give you a better idea.

e.g. If you are submitting a fix for an issue in frontend, the PR name should be prefixed with **`fix(FE):`**

- Follow [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) guidelines for your contribution flows.

- Feel free to ping us on `#contributing-to-olake` on our slack community if you need any help.
