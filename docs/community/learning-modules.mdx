## Learning Modules

Before jumping in and setting up a development environment and contributing to OLake, if you have limited knowledge of the required technologies and tools, this is the section where you should learn everything important that's required. This page hosts **learning modules** covering essential concepts and technologies that will help you get started with OLake development.

These modules are listed in the **recommended order of priority** for OLake contributors.

### 1. Golang (Go)

OLake is primarily written in **Golang**, so having a solid grasp of Go makes it much easier to understand the codebase, contribute features, and debug issues.

- **If you prefer videos**: Watch this YouTube playlist for a step‑by‑step Go learning path (from basics to advanced topics):  
  - [Golang Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoJ8Sw5Yb4c&list=PLRAV69dS1uWQGDQoBYMZWKjzuhCaOnBpa)

- **If you prefer reading and already know basic programming concepts**: Follow this structured Go tutorial series:  
  - [Go Language Tutorial – GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/go-language/go/)

Focus on:
**Need inputs from interns**

---

### 2. Docker

OLake heavily uses **Docker** for local development and the Docker CLI workflow. Understanding Docker helps you:
- Run OLake containers correctly
- Understand volumes, networks, and images used in the examples
- Debug environment‑related issues

### 3. ETL and ELT

OLake is fundamentally a **data migration / ETL tool**, so understanding ETL/ELT concepts is critical:
- What it means to **extract**, **transform**, and **load** data
- How data flows from operational systems into warehouses or lakehouses
- Why transformation might happen before (ETL) or after loading (ELT)

Recommended reading:
- [What is ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)? – AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/etl/)

---

### 4. Apache Iceberg

OLake writes data into **Apache Iceberg** tables, which is the core table format powering many OLake destinations. Understanding Iceberg helps you reason about:
- How OLake writes snapshots, data files, and metadata
- How schema evolution and partitioning work
- Why Iceberg is chosen over traditional table formats

Recommended video:
- [Introduction to Apache Iceberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsmhRZElPvM)

Key concepts to grasp:
- Snapshots and time‑travel
- Partitioning
- Manifest files and metadata

**Also if anything important then provide more inputs**

### 5. Change Data Capture (CDC)

OLake supports **CDC (Change Data Capture)** and **Incremental syncs**. Knowing CDC concepts helps you understand:
- How OLake tracks inserts, updates, and deletes over time
- Why resume tokens, log positions, and state files (`state.json`) are important
- How incremental syncs differ from full refreshes

Recommended reading:
- [Change Data Capture (CDC): What It Is and How It Works – Striim](https://www.striim.com/blog/change-data-capture-cdc-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/)

Focus on:
- The high‑level CDC flow (source logs → captured changes → target)
- Common CDC implementation patterns (log‑based CDC, triggers, etc.)
