### Submit Ideas or Feature Requests

The best way to start is by discussing your idea in the OLake Slack community first. This helps get early feedback, gauge interest, and refine your proposal with input form other community members.

After the Slack discussion, open a GitHub Discussion in the Ideas category to propose features or enhancements. Describe the desired behavior in detail, including examples where helpful. Keep the proposal tightly scoped so it’s easy to review and implement. This is a volunteer-driven project—well-defined, thoughtful ideas are always appreciated.

When submitting your proposal, consider including:

- Requirement — what kind of use case are you trying to solve?
- Proposal — what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?
- Any open questions to address❓

## Types of contributors

OLake recognizes two primary contributor roles, each with distinct responsibilities and privileges within the project:

### Project Maintainers

Project Maintainers guide OLake by sorting and prioritizing issues, reviewing and merging pull requests in all repositories, and coordinating releases.

### Contributors

Contributors include anyone who engages with OLake by submitting code, reporting bugs, writing documentation, proposing improvements, or helping on community channels. All contributions—large or small—are welcome.

## Goodies

We know how much you love swags and stickers, for each PR merged (again, not typo fixes or documentation fixes) we will send over a Tshirt and stickers to you. Take a sneak peak below.

**Note:** PR qualifying for goodies is subject to value it adds and the OLake team approval.
