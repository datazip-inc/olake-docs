## Steps to Debug
1. Make a directory `.vscode` (inside OLake project, at root location) if not already created.
2. Create a file named `launch.json` inside the `.vscode` directory and paste the beflow config.


```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch Go Code",
            "type": "go",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "{PATH_TO_UPDATE}/drivers/mongodb/main.go",
            "mode": "auto",
            "args": [
                "sync",
                "--config",
                "{PATH_TO_UPDATE}/drivers/mongodb/examples/config.json",
                "--catalog",
                "{PATH_TO_UPDATE}/drivers/mongodb/examples/catalog.json",
                "--destination",
                "{PATH_TO_UPDATE}/drivers/mongodb/examples/writer.json",
                // "--state",
                // "{PATH_TO_UPDATE}/drivers/mongodb/examples/state.json",
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Params:
| key | value(s) |
| --- | --- |
|`mode` | `auto`, `debug` |
| `args` | `sync` , `discover` |

Update `PATH_TO_UPDATE` with the location where OLake project lives inside your system. For example:

```json
"program": "/Users/john/Desktop/projects/olake/drivers/mongodb/main.go",
...
    "--config",
    "/Users/john/Desktop/projects/olake/drivers/mongodb/examples/config.json",
...          
```
Now, setup debug points in the codebase and click "Launch Go Code".
