<TabItem value="features" label="Feature/Tasks">

The best way to start is by discussing your idea in the OLake Slack community first. This helps get early feedback, gauge interest, and refine your proposal with input form other community members.

After the Slack discussion, open a GitHub Discussion in the Ideas category to propose features or enhancements. Describe the desired behavior in detail, including examples where helpful. Keep the proposal tightly scoped so it's easy to review and implement. This is a volunteer-driven project—well-defined, thoughtful ideas are always appreciated.

When submitting your proposal, consider including:

- Requirement — what kind of use case are you trying to solve?
- Proposal — what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?
- Any open questions to address❓

### Contributing to Solve an Issue

If you’d like to contribute code or docs, check existing GitHub issues and pick one that fits your interest:
- **Fix Bugs** → Work on issues labeled bug
- **Implement Features** → Work on issues labeled feature
- **Complete Tasks** → Work on issues labeled task

### A good start will be to explore:

**Issues to work on:**
- [first good issues](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22)
- [good second issues](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20second%20issue%22)

**Getting started guides:**
- [Setting up a Development Environment](./setting-up-a-dev-env) - Learn how to set up your local development environment
- [How to Raise a PR](./issues-and-prs) - Step-by-step guide for creating pull requests

See the issues and if its looks interesting enough to you, comment on it and one of our maintainers will reply to you on the same issue.

## Types of contributors

OLake recognizes two primary contributor roles, each with distinct responsibilities and privileges within the project:

### Project Maintainers

Project Maintainers guide OLake by sorting and prioritizing issues, reviewing and merging pull requests in all repositories, and coordinating releases.

### Contributors

Contributors include anyone who engages with OLake by submitting code, reporting bugs, writing documentation, proposing improvements, or helping on community channels. All contributions—large or small—are welcome.

## Goodies

We know how much you love swags and stickers, for each PR merged (again, not typo fixes or documentation fixes) we will send over a Tshirt and stickers to you. Take a sneak peak below.

**Note:** PR qualifying for goodies is subject to value it adds and the OLake team approval.
