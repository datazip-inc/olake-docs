For Contributing to OLake, refer the guide [here](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) (detailed Contributing guide comming soon)

A good start will be to explore:
- [first good issues](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22)

See the issues and if its looks interesting enough to you, comment below them and one of our maintainers will get in touch with you.

You can also refer to the [projects](https://github.com/orgs/datazip-inc/projects/5) section in GitHub to see who all are working on which issues.

Refer [here](../connectors/mongodb/docker-compose) to build mongodb replicaset.

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:datazip-inc/olake.git
```

### Create a Pull Request

#### Make A Branch
- Please create a separate branch for each issue that you're working on. Do not make changes to the default branch (e.g. master, staging) of your fork.

```bash
git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>
```

To check your current branch,

```bash
git branch
```

To get back to an existing branch

```bash
git checkout <EXISTING_BRANCH_NAME> 
```

or

```bash
git switch <EXISTING_BRANCH_NAME> 
```

### Add, verify and push changes
#### 1. Add your changes
```bash
git add . 
```

#### 2. verify

Perform `git status` or `git diff` to see what all changes occured, which all files are ready to be committed (or staged)


#### 3. Commit
After you are done with all the changes, perform

```sh
git commit -am "write a descriptive message here about the nature of changes / addition of code"
```

:::caution
Commits needs to be verified via signing gpg keys. Pull Requests with non-verified commits will not be accepted. Follow [this guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/signed_commits/gpg/) to set up commit signing.
:::

Next, take a pull (in case any new code has been added, this will help you avoid merge conflicts) by doing `git pull` and then `git push origin <YOUR_FEATURE_BRANCH_NAME>`.


#### Push Your Code ASAP
- Push your code as soon as you can. Follow the "early and often" rule.
- Make a pull request as soon as you can and mark the title with a "[WIP]". You can create a draft pull request.

#### Describe Your Pull Request
- Use the format specified in pull request template for the repository. Populate the pull request descriptioncompletely for maximum verbosity.
    - Tag the actual issue number by replacing #[issue_number] e.g. #42. This closes the issue when your PR is merged.
    - Tag the actual issue author by replacing @[author] e.g. @issue_author. This brings the reporter of the issue into the conversation.
    - Mark the tasks off your checklist by adding an x in the [ ] e.g. [x]. This checks off the boxes in your to-do list. The more boxes you check, the better.

- Describe your change in detail. Too much detail is better than too little.
- Describe how you tested your change.
- Check the Preview tab to make sure the Markdown is correctly rendered and that all tags and references are linked. If not, go back and edit the Markdown.

### Request Review
- Once your PR is ready, remove the "[WIP]" from the title and/or change it from a draft PR to a regular PR.
- If a specific reviewer is not assigned automatically, please request a review from the project maintainer.

## Debugging OLake 

### Assumptions
1. You are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to run OLake locally.
2. You have cloned the project in a suitable directory.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:datazip-inc/olake.git
```

:::caution
Please read [getting started with OLake](../category/getting-started) guide before proceeding to follow along this guide

## Steps to Debug
1. Make a directory `.vscode` (inside OLake project, at root location) if not already created.
2. Create a file named `launch.json` inside the `.vscode` directory and paste the beflow config.


```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch Go Code",
            "type": "go",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "{PATH_TO_UPDATE}/drivers/mongodb/main.go",
            "mode": "auto",
            "args": [
                "sync",
                "--config",
                "{PATH_TO_UPDATE}/drivers/mongodb/examples/config.json",
                "--catalog",
                "{PATH_TO_UPDATE}/drivers/mongodb/examples/catalog.json",
                "--destination",
                "{PATH_TO_UPDATE}/drivers/mongodb/examples/writer.json",
                // "--state",
                // "{PATH_TO_UPDATE}/drivers/mongodb/examples/state.json",
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Params:
| key | value(s) |
| --- | --- |
|`mode` | `auto`, `debug` |
| `args` | `sync` , `discover` |

Update `PATH_TO_UPDATE` with the location where OLake project lives inside your system. For example:

```json
"program": "/Users/john/Desktop/projects/olake/drivers/mongodb/main.go",
...
    "--config",
    "/Users/john/Desktop/projects/olake/drivers/mongodb/examples/config.json",
...          
```
Now, setup debug points in the codebase and click "Launch Go Code".
