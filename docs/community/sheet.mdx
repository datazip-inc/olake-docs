# OLake Community Contributors Sheet

Welcome to the Olake Contributor Sheet!

Olake is an open source project maintained by Datazip, dedicated to building an innovative, transparent, and collaborative platform. This sheet is designed to track the ongoing work of our community—showing who is working on which issue, feature, or task at any given moment.

**How to Use This Sheet:**

- **Stay Informed:** Check the spreadsheet below to see the latest updates on open issues and the contributors assigned to them.
- **Collaborate:** If you’re interested in taking on an issue or starting a new contribution, find available tasks listed here.
- **Transparency:** We believe that open collaboration is key to continuous improvement. This sheet helps maintain clarity on the project’s progress and encourages active participation.
