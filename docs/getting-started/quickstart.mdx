# How to get started with OLake
This QuickStart guide helps get started with OLake UI, a web-based interface designed to simplify the management of OLake jobs, sources, destinations, and configurations. 

## Prerequisites

The following requirements must be met before starting:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed (Docker Desktop recommended)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (included with Docker Desktop)
- At least 4GB RAM available for Docker
- Port 8000 available on the system

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

### One-Command Setup
The fastest way to get OLake UI running is with a single command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datazip-inc/olake-ui/master/docker-compose.yml | docker compose -f - up -d
```

This command will:
- Download the latest docker-compose.yml file
- Pull all required Docker images
- Start all services in the background
- Create a default admin user automatically

### Access the Application

- **OLake UI**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Login

The default credentials are:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password`
