# Playground
A self-contained developer playground to explore lakehouse architecture using Apache Iceberg with: 

* **MySQL** as the source database   
* **OLake** for schema discovery and CDC ingestion via a UI   
* **MinIO** as the object store   
* **Temporal** to orchestrate ingestion workflows   
* **Presto** to query Iceberg table 

🎯 Goal: Let developers experience an Iceberg-native lakehouse end-to-end — without needing to stitch services or write config files — using a single docker-compose up. 


## ✨ Features

* CDC from MySQL to Iceberg   
* Schema discovery and ingestion via **OLake UI**   
* Tables automatically created in **Iceberg format**   
* Presto queries with no manual registration   
* Visual orchestration with **Temporal UI**   
* 2 setup process using Docker Compose 


## 🧱 Architecture
```
MySQL --> init_cdc_user         
	↘︎    	↘︎     
data_loader   binlog_checker          
  	↓       
OLake (UI) --> Iceberg (MinIO)   
               	↘︎                     
               	Presto     
OLake Services:    
- Temporal    
- PostgreSQL (Temporal DB)    
- Temporal Worker    
- Temporal UI    
- Elasticsearch (Temporal search)    
```

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

* Docker + Docker Compose   
* ~8 GB RAM   
* Git 


## 🏁 Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake.git
cd examples    
```

### 2. Setup

* **Edit persistence/config paths (optional):**   
  The docker-compose.yml uses /your/chosen/host/path/olake-data as a placeholder for the host directory where Olake's persistent data and configuration will be stored. You **must** replace this with an actual path on your system before starting the services. You can change this by editing the x-app-defaults section at the top of docker-compose.yml: 

```yaml
x-app-defaults:   
  host_persistence_path: &hostPersistencePath /your/host/path   
```

Make sure the directory exists and is writable by the user running Docker (see how to change [file permissions for Linux/macOS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_permissions_and_attributes#Changing_permissions)). 


* **Customizing Admin User (optional):**   
  The stack automatically creates an initial admin user on first startup. The default credentials are:   
  `Username`: "admin"   
  `Password`: "password"   
  `Email`: "test@example.com”   
  To change these defaults, edit the x-signup-defaults section in your docker-compose.yml: 

x-signup-defaults:   
username: &defaultUsername "your-custom-username"   
password: &defaultPassword "your-secure-password"   
email: &defaultEmail "your-email@example.com"   

### **3. Launch the Playground**   

```sh
docker-compose up --build    
```

This will spin up: 

* **MySQL** + “init-mysql-tasks” helpers:   
  ”init-mysql-tasks" sets up the following things:   
    * setup the cdc: sets up replication privileges   
    * load data: inserts sample data   
    * health checks: verifies setup   
* **OLake** backend services (UI + ingestion pipeline)   
* **Temporal** (Orchestration if required)   
* **MinIO**: Iceberg object store 

Once this is setup, we can spin up Presto to check and query the iceberg table by running the following commands:   

```sh
cd presto   
docker run -d --name my-olake-presto-coordinator    
  	--network app-network    
  	-p 80:8080    
  	-v "$(pwd)/etc:/opt/presto-server/etc"    
  	prestodb/presto:latest   
```

The above command will first move to the presto directory where all the necessary config are already setup and the next one spins up the docker container within required network and port.   

## 💻 OLake UI Walkthrough

1. Access OLake UI: http://localhost:8000   
   You will be asked to add username and password, please add the same username and password which you added in docker compose file, if you are using default it will be:   
   `username`: admin   
   `password`: password   
2. Choose **MySQL** as the source and name the source it can be as simple as `mysql_temp`   
   If you plan to use the MySQL setup within the docker as a source use following config:   
   To set up a Source connection to the `primary_mysql` database within Olake:   
* Host: `host.docker.internal`   
* Port: 3306   
* Database: employees   
* User: root   
* Password: password 

![olake-iceberg-presto-1](/img/docs/playground/olake-iceberg-presto-1.png)
 

3. Add Destination Details and choose Iceberg Connector and Rest as the catalog   
   Use following credentials to sync directly to set up a Destination connection for Apache Iceberg within Olake:   
* Iceberg REST Catalog URL: `http://host.docker.internal:8181`   
* Iceberg S3 Path (example): `s3://warehouse/employees/`   
* Iceberg Database (example): `employees`   
* S3 Endpoint (for Iceberg data files written by Olake workers): `http://host.docker.internal:9090`   
* AWS Region: `us-east-1`   
* S3 Access Key: `minio`   
* S3 Secret Key: `minio123`

4. Use the UI to:   Select tables & fields   
   ![olake-iceberg-presto-3](/img/docs/playground/olake-iceberg-presto-3.png)
      
5. Add the job name and frequency (frequency can be optional if you are only trying to have a one time sync just to check out the iceberg ecosystem):   
   ![olake-iceberg-presto-4](/img/docs/playground/olake-iceberg-presto-4.png)
      
6. Create the jobs and run the sync manually to start seeing data in Iceberg   
    ![olake-iceberg-presto-5](/img/docs/playground/olake-iceberg-presto-5.png)
      
7. (optional) You can check the logs in jobs history section 

You don't need to manually register tables — OLake writes directly in Iceberg format and Presto can pick them up automatically.   


**🔍 Query in Presto**   
To Use Web UI, access the following in your browser   

```
http://localhost:80/ui/   
```

![olake-iceberg-presto-6](/img/docs/playground/olake-iceberg-presto-6.png)
   
You can run the SQL queries in SQL client within this UI or in CLI to be accessed post docker exec in the presto container.

For UI, where “Iceberg” is the catalog and “olake_iceberg_test” is your schema, you can run the `SELECT * FROM iceberg.olake_iceberg_test.sample_table LIMIT 10;` to checkout the sample table loaded in previous step:   

![olake-iceberg-presto-7](/img/docs/playground/olake-iceberg-presto-7.png)
   
You’ll be querying live Iceberg tables stored in MinIO and created automatically by OLake.   

Or   

You can run the `presto-cli` inside the coordinator container with the below command:   

```sh
docker exec -it presto-coordinator presto-cli   
presto>
```

After you run the command, the prompt should change from the shell prompt $ to the presto> CLI prompt. Run the SQL statement `show catalogs` to see a list of currently configured catalogs:   

```sh
presto> show catalogs;   
 Catalog    
---------   
 iceberg    
 system   
```
 
We'll be working almost exclusively with the "iceberg" catalog and "olake_iceberg_test" schema, so we can employ a USE statement to indicate that all the queries we run will be against tables in this catalog/schema combination unless specificed. Otherwise, we would have to use the fully-qualified table name for every statement (i.e., `iceberg.olake_iceberg_test.<table_name>`).   

```sh
presto> USE iceberg.employees;   
USE   
presto:employees>   
```

After you run the command, the prompt should change from the shell prompt `presto>` to the `presto:olake_iceberg_test>` CLI prompt.   
You can run SQL commands here like `show tables;`   

```sh
presto:employees> show tables;   
  	Table          
------------------   
 dept_emp            
 dept_manager        
 employees           
 olake_test_table    
 salaries            
 titles              
```

We can query some of the Iceberg metadata information from Presto. Let's look at the hidden "history" table from Presto. Note that the quotation marks are required here.   

```sh
presto:olake_iceberg_test> select * from "dept_emp$history";   
   	made_current_at   	| 	 snapshot_id 	|  	parent_id  	| is_current_ancestor    
-----------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------

```

This shows us that we have a snapshot that was created at the moment we inserted data. We can get more details about the snapshot with the below query:   

```sh
presto:olake_iceberg_test> SELECT * FROM "dept_emp$snapshots";   
    	committed_at     	| 	 snapshot_id 	|  	parent_id  	| operation |                                                    	man>   
-----------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------------------- >   
 2025-05-27 09:57:09.749 UTC | 3459967128286778433 | NULL            	| overwrite | s3://warehouse/olake_iceberg_test/sample_table/metadata/sn>   
 2025-05-27 09:57:10.482 UTC | 4648278466592688978 | 3459967128286778433 | overwrite | s3://warehouse/olake_iceberg_test/sample_table/metadata/sn>   
```

This gets us a little more information, such as the type of operation, the manifest list file that this snapshot refers to, as well as a summary of the changes that were made as a result of this operation.   

Let's go one level deeper and look at the current manifest list metadata:   

```sh
presto:olake_iceberg_test> SELECT * FROM "dept_emp$manifests";   
                                             	path                                              	| length | partition_spec_id |  added_snaps>   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+-------------------+------------->

```

There are other hidden tables as well that you can interrogate. Here is a summary of all hidden tables that Presto can provide: 

* `$properties`: General properties of the given table   
* `$history`: History of table state changes   
* `$snapshots`: Details about the table snapshots   
* `$manifests`: Details about the manifest lists of different table snapshots   
* `$partitions`: Detailed partition information for the table   
* `$files`: Overview of data files in the current snapshot of the table 


## 🧪 Things to Try

* Load more data → rerun sync or enable CDC → query again (check out following docs on understanding how to add more data in MySQL: [https://olake.io/docs/connectors/mysql/setup/local#4-perform-ddl-and-dml-operations-to-test-olake-optional](https://olake.io/docs/connectors/mysql/setup/local#4-perform-ddl-and-dml-operations-to-test-olake-optional) )   
* Watch jobs run live in **Temporal UI** (http://localhost:8081)   
  
  ![olake-iceberg-presto-8](/img/docs/playground/olake-iceberg-presto-8.png)
     
* Inspect table files in MinIO (http://localhost:8443)   
  ![olake-iceberg-presto-9](/img/docs/playground/olake-iceberg-presto-9.png)
     
* **Iceberg schema evolution**   
  The Iceberg connector also supports in-place table evolution, aka schema evolution, such as adding, dropping, and renaming columns. This is one of Iceberg's key features.   

  You can add more columns in Primary MySQL DB, which is used as source here via the DDL and DML operations (check out following docs on understanding how to add more data in MySQL: [https://olake.io/docs/connectors/mysql/setup/local#4-perform-ddl-and-dml-operations-to-test-olake-optional](https://olake.io/docs/connectors/mysql/setup/local#4-perform-ddl-and-dml-operations-to-test-olake-optional) ) and understand how metadata files change along with addition of new snapshot.   
* **Iceberg Time Travel**   
  Another popular feature of Iceberg is time travel, wherein we can query the table state from a given time or snapshot ID. It's also possible to rollback the state of a table to a previous snapshot using its ID. 

```sh
**📁 Key Files**   
├── docker-compose.yaml    	# Spins up source db, olake, iceberg rest and minio    
├── olake-data/          	# to save all the olake data like configs    
├── presto   
    	├── README.md   
    	├── etc   
        		├── config.properties   
        		├── jvm.config   
        		├── catalog   
                		├── iceberg.properties   
├── README.md    
```

No manual configuration or table registration needed. Just OLake UI + Presto + Iceberg.
