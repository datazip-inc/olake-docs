# Clear Destination

If a previous sync wrote incorrect data (for example, a missing filter, the wrong partitioning, or normalization turned off), manual deletion of files or tables is unnecessary. Clear Destination is the safe, built‑in way to reset the destination for one job so that the next run rebuilds a clean, correct snapshot.

It can be considered a reset mechanism for a job’s destination outputs.

:::::caution This action is destructive
Clear Destination deletes already‑synced data for the job’s enabled streams at the destination. It cannot be canceled once it starts. Ensure that data can be re‑created from the source and that the job has permission to delete data.
:::::

## How it works in OLake

- Job‑level behavior: Clear Destination applies to one job at a time
- Stream‑aware: Only the job’s enabled streams are cleared other streams remain unaffected
- Exclusive while running: Job Settings or Edit Streams cannot be saved until the clear destination process completes
- Not cancellable: Once started, it will run until completion and cannot be stalled mid way (to avoid half‑deleted outputs)
- Scheduling: The job’s regular sync will not start until the clear destination process finishes; other jobs will run as scheduled normally
- Running job protection: If a sync is running, cancellation of that particular job is required before starting a clear destination 

## Scenarios to Trigger Clear Destination

### 1) Click Clear Destination in Job Settings
- What happens: Selecting Clear Destination opens a confirmation modal. After confirmation, the Clear Destination job starts and the UI redirects to Job Logs & History to monitor progress. If a sync with respect to that job is currently running, it must be canceled first.
- Example: Job "daily_orders" has enabled streams `orders` and `customers`. Clear Destination is initiated → both streams are cleared at the destination. The next run (scheduled or Sync Now) rebuilds both streams using the latest configuration.

### 2) Stream-level property changes in previously syncing streams
When stream settings that have already synced are changed, OLake clears only the affected streams so they can be rebuilt consistently. If a job is running, OLake auto‑cancels the current run after confirmation and starts Clear Destination for those streams.

- Normalization changes
  - Example: Normalization is enabled so destination naming changes from raw to standardized table/column names. OLake clears the affected stream(s); the next run writes with normalized names.

- Filter changes
  - Example: A filter for the last 12 months (`order_date >= 2024-01-01`) is added. OLake clears that stream; the next run writes only filtered rows.

- Sync Mode changes
  - Example: A stream is switched from Incremental to Full Refresh. OLake clears that stream so the next run writes a complete snapshot that matches the new mode.

- Incremental Cursor / Fallback Cursor value changes
  - Example: The cursor is changed from `updated_at` to `id`, or a fallback timestamp is adjusted. OLake clears the stream to realign state; the next run resumes using the new cursor.

- Partition changes
  - Example: Partitioning is changed from day to month to reduce file counts. OLake clears the stream; the next run writes new monthly partitions.

- Destination DB name change
  - Example: The destination DB is renamed from `sales_raw` to `sales_curated`. OLake clears the stream; the next run writes to the new DB path.

- Append/Upsert mode change
  - Example: The mode is switched from append to upsert to deduplicate by a primary key. OLake clears the stream; the next run reconstructs with upsert semantics.

Result: Only the modified streams are dropped and rebuilt at the next run; other enabled streams are unaffected.

:::::tip Full Refresh vs Clear Destination
- Full Refresh streams are dropped and rebuilt on every sync by design. 
- Clear Destination is a one‑time reset that can be triggered (for all enabled streams from Job Settings, or only affected streams when editing). Both can co‑exist in the same job.
:::::

What happens next:
- OLake drops the affected streams from the destination so they can be rebuilt by the next run
- If the job is running, OLake auto‑cancels the current run after confirmation and initiates Clear Destination for the affected streams
- If the job is idle, the clear is queued; once it completes, the next run (scheduled or “Sync Now”) rebuilds with the new settings


## What appears in the UI

- Job Settings page: A Clear Destination button opens a confirmation modal. If a run is active, cancellation is required before proceeding
- Edit Streams: Changing any previously syncing stream prompts a confirmation; if a run is active, OLake auto‑cancels it after confirmation and begins the clear for the affected streams
- Job Logs & History: A “Job Type” column indicates whether a run is a Sync or Clear Destination so progress and outcomes can be followed. 

## Step‑by‑step Workflow 

1. Clear Destination is triggered
2. OLake checks if the job is currently running
   - If running, cancellation is required first 
3. OLake deletes destination data for the job’s enabled streams (or only affected streams)
4. Clear completes → The job becomes editable again; the next run rebuilds the destination with the corrected settings
