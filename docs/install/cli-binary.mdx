# Binary (CLI)
OLake CLI commands can be directly executed using the binary file. 

## Prerequisites
- Internet access to browse GitHub  
- Git installed on the host machine to clone the OLake repository.

## Configuration and Setup

### 1. Clone the OLake GitHub repository
Navigate to the [OLake GitHub repository](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake) and clone it to the host machine:
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    ![OLake Repo](/img/docs/install/olake-cli-binary/olake-repo.png)
    </div>

### 2. Generate the binary file
Inside the cloned repository, the build.sh script is available and is executed to generate the binary file.
    <div className="flex justify-center w-full">
    <div className="w-2/5">
    ![OLake Repo](/img/docs/install/olake-cli-binary/buildSh.png)
    </div>
    </div>
    OLake supports multiple database drivers. Use the correct `[DRIVER-NAME]` from the following table when building the binary.
<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", textAlign: "center"}}>

| Driver Name | [DRIVER-NAME] |
|-------------|---------------|
| Postgres    | `postgres`    |
| MySQL       | `mysql`       |
| Oracle      | `oracle`      |
| MongoDB     | `mongodb`     |
</div>
**Build Command**
```
./build.sh driver-[DRIVER-NAME]
```
### 3. Locate the Binary file
    After the above command is executed successfully, the OLake binary is generated inside the cloned repository under the drivers/[DRIVER-NAME] directory.
    <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    ![OLake Repo](/img/docs/install/olake-cli-binary/creating-binary.gif) <br/>
    Example: Oracle driver's binary generation
    </div>
    This generated binary file can be used to run the OLake CLI commands.
    <div className="flex justify-center w-full">
    <div className="w-2/5">
    ![OLake Repo](/img/docs/install/olake-cli-binary/binary-file.png)
    </div>
    </div>
## Next Steps
After the initial configuration is completed:

1. Create a folder to store configuration files such as `source.json` and `destination.json`.  
2. Refer to the driver-specific documentation for detailed configuration options and CLI commands.
