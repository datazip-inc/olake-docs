# OLake UI

OLake UI provides a complete Docker Compose stack for running the OLake data replication platform.

## Components

- **OLake UI**: Main web interface for job management and configuration
- **Temporal Worker**: Background worker for processing data replication jobs
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for storing job data, configurations, and sync state
- **Temporal Server**: Workflow orchestration engine for managing job execution
- **Temporal UI**: Web interface for monitoring workflows and debugging
- **Elasticsearch**: Search and indexing backend for Temporal workflow data
- **Signup Init**: One-time initialization service that creates the default admin user

## Prerequisites

The following requirements must be met before starting:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed (Docker Desktop recommended)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (included with Docker Desktop)
- At least 4GB RAM available for Docker
- Port 8000 available on the system

## Quick Start

### One-Command Setup

The fastest way to get OLake UI running is with a single command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datazip-inc/olake-ui/master/docker-compose.yml | docker compose -f - up -d
```

This command will:
- Download the latest docker-compose.yml file
- Pull all required Docker images
- Start all services in the background
- Create a default admin user automatically

### Access the Application

- **OLake UI**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Login

The default credentials are:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password`

## Using OLake UI

Once the stack is running, the following operations can be performed:

1. **Create Jobs**: Data replication jobs can be set up between sources and destinations
2. **Configure Sources**: Connectors for databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL or Oracle DB can be established
3. **Configure Destinations**: Apache Iceberg or AWS S3 as targets can be configured
4. **Monitor Jobs**: Job execution can be tracked and logs can be viewed

For detailed job creation instructions, see [Create Jobs](../jobs/create-jobs).

## Service Configuration

### Changing Admin Credentials

The default admin user can be customized by editing the `docker-compose.yml` file before starting:

```yaml
x-signup-defaults:
  username: &defaultUsername "your-username"
  password: &defaultPassword "your-secure-password"
  email: &defaultEmail "your-email@example.com"
```

### Encryption Key Configuration

OLake supports encryption of source and destination configurations stored in the database. Configure the encryption key in `docker-compose.yml`:

- **Custom String**: Provide any string (OLake generates SHA-256 hash):

  ```yaml
  x-encryption:
    key: &encryptionKey "your-passphrase"
  ```

- **AWS KMS**: Use a AWS KMS key ARN (recommended for production):

  ```yaml
  x-encryption:
    key: &encryptionKey "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
  ```

- **Disable Encryption**: Use empty string:

  ```yaml
  x-encryption:
    key: &encryptionKey ""  # No Encryption
  ```

### Customizing Data Directory

The default data directory can be changed by modifying the host persistence path:

```yaml
x-app-defaults:
  host_persistence_path: &hostPersistencePath /custom/path/to/olake-data
  worker_config_volume_details: &workerConfigVolumeDetails
    type: bind
    source: *hostPersistencePath
    target: /tmp/olake-config
```

This will create and use `/custom/path/to/olake-data` instead of the default `./olake-data` directory.

### Service Environment Variables

Key environment variables that can be customized within specific services:

```yaml
services:
  olake-ui:
    environment:
      PERSISTENT_DIR: *hostPersistencePath
      POSTGRES_DB: "postgres://olake:olake@postgresql:5432/olakedb"
      OLAKE_SECRET_KEY: *encryptionKey
```

### Data Persistence

The Docker Compose setup creates the following data storage:

#### OLake Config Directory
- `olake-data`: Local directory created in the current working directory
  - Contains streams configurations, connection settings, and sync state
  - Persists across container restarts and recreations
  - Used by OLake UI and Temporal Worker services

#### Docker Volumes
- `temporal-postgresql-data`: PostgreSQL database storage
  - Contains workflow execution history, job metadata and sync state
  - Used by the PostgreSQL service
- `temporal-elasticsearch-data`: Elasticsearch search index storage
  - Used by the Elasticsearch service

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Viewing Logs

Logs from all services can be viewed with:
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

Logs from a specific service can be viewed with:
```bash
docker compose logs -f olake-ui
docker compose logs -f temporal-worker
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Port Conflicts
If port binding errors occur:
1. Check what's using the ports: `lsof -i :8000` (on macOS/Linux)
2. Stop conflicting services or change ports in `docker-compose.yml`

#### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure PostgreSQL container is healthy: `docker compose ps`
- Check PostgreSQL logs: `docker compose logs postgresql`

#### Memory Issues
- Ensure Docker has at least 4GB RAM allocated
- Check Docker resource usage: `docker stats`

#### Permission Issues
- On Linux, ensure the user is in the docker group
- Check file permissions for the `./olake-data/` directory (or custom path if modified)

### Reset Everything

The stack can be completely reset with:
```bash
docker compose down -v  # Removes containers and volumes
docker compose up -d    # Fresh start
```

**Warning**: This will delete all job data and configurations.
