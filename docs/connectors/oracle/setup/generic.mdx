# Generic Oracle Setup Guide

This guide explains the required Oracle permissions to enable OLake to perform full refresh and incremental sync. It applies to Oracle databases running on any infrastructure.

## Oracle Permissions Required

To allow OLake to perform operations, the following **grants** must be applied to the user used in your source configuration:

| **Privilege**     | **Purpose** | **Grant Query** | **Error Without It** |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| `CREATE SESSION` | Fundamental login ability | `GRANT CREATE SESSION TO <username>;` | `ORA-01045: user <username> lacks CREATE SESSION privilege; logon denied` |
| `EXECUTE ON DBMS_FLASHBACK` | Required to fetch SCN | `GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_FLASHBACK TO <username>;` | `ORA-00904: "SYS"."DBMS_FLASHBACK": invalid identifier` |
| `SELECT ON <owner>.<table>` | Read data from source table | `GRANT SELECT ON <table_owner>.<table_name> TO <username>;` | `ORA-00942: table or view does not exist` |
| `FLASHBACK ON <owner>.<table>` | Perform Flashback AS OF queries on the table | `GRANT FLASHBACK ON <table_owner>.<table_name> TO <username>;` | `ORA-01031: insufficient privileges` |

## Where and Why Each Privilege is Needed

### 1. `CREATE SESSION`

- **Use**: Allows the Oracle user to connect to the database
- **Without this**: The connection cannot be established.

### 2. `EXECUTE ON DBMS_FLASHBACK`

- **Use**: To run `DBMS_FLASHBACK.GET_SYSTEM_CHANGE_NUMBER`, which is used to fetch the current SCN during backfill.
- **Without this**: Current user will be unable to retrieve the SCN.

### 3. `SELECT ON <table>`

- **Use**: Enables read access to the specified table(s) for the Oracle user.
- **Without this**: User will be unable to discover or read from the table during backfill or incremental sync.

### 4. `FLASHBACK ON <table>`

- **Use**: Required for queries like `SELECT * FROM table AS OF SCN <scn>` during chunk iteration.
- **Without this**: Flashback queries will fail for that table.

## How to Check Permissions

Use the following queries to verify granted privileges:

```sql
-- List system-level privileges granted to your session
SELECT * FROM SESSION_PRIVS;

-- List all the object-level privileges which the current user has been granted
SELECT * FROM USER_TAB_PRIVS;
