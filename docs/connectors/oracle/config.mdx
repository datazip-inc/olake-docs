# Configurations

## `source.json` Configuration

Below is a sample `source.json` for connecting to a Oracle replica set. Customize each field to match your environment.

<OracleSourceConfig/>

## Description of above parameters

<OracleSourceConfigDetails/>


## `streams.json` Configuration


Here we explain the structure and contents of your `streams.json` file, which is used to configure and manage data streams. It covers the following topics:

- Overall File Structure
- Selected Streams
- Streams and Their Configuration
- Type Schema: Properties and Data Types
- Key-Value Pair Explanation
- Synchronization Modes

### 1. Overall File Structure

The `streams.json` file is organized into two main sections:

- **`selected_streams`:** Lists the streams that have been chosen for processing. These are grouped by namespace.
- **`streams`:** Contains an array of stream definitions. Each stream holds details about its data schema, supported synchronization modes, primary keys, and other metadata.

### 2. Selected Streams

The **`selected_streams`** section groups streams by their namespace(database name). For example, the configuration might look like this:

<SelectedStreamsOnly/>

### Selected Streams Details

<SelectedStreamsOnlyDetails/>

For more information about `partition_regex`, refer to [Iceberg Partition Documentation](/docs/writers/iceberg/partitioning) or [S3 Partition Documentation](../../writers/parquet/partitioning).


### 3. Streams

The **streams** section is an array where each element is an object that defines a specific data stream. Each stream object includes a **stream** key that holds the configuration details. For example, one stream definition looks like this:

<StreamsOnly/>


#### 3.1 Stream Configuration Elements

<StreamsOnlyDetails/>


### 4. Type Schema: Properties and Data Types

The **`type_schema`** is central to defining what data each stream will handle. Under this schema:

#### 4.1 Properties Object

The **properties** object is a collection of key-value pairs where:
- **`Key`:** Represents the name of the property or field (e.g., `"title"`, `"authors"`, `"publish_date"`).
- **`Value`:** Is an object that describes the property's allowed data types.

For example:

```json
"_id": {
  "type": ["string"]
}
```

This definition means that the `_id` property must be a string.

A field can allow multiple types. For instance:

```json
"coordinates": {
    "type": [
        "null",
        "object"
    ]
},
```

This means the `coordinates` field is presently `null` but is of object data type.


### 5. Synchronization Modes

The streams file specifies how streams should be synchronized:


| **Component**           | **Description**                                                                       | **Possible Values**                                                    |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`supported_sync_modes`**| Lists all the modes a stream supports.                                                | `full_refresh` - (a complete reload of the data)|
| **`sync_mode`**           | Indicates which mode is actively being used for that stream.                         | `full_refresh`                                                  |
