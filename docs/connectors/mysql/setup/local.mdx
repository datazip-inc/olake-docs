# Setup MySQL Replica Set via Docker Compose (local)
This guide explains how to spawn a MySQL replica set using Docker Compose. It also covers instructions for ingesting sample data, and verifying the setup.

:::note
This compose file is not for production use. It is meant for local development and testing purposes only. It spawns a single MySQL instance with a replica set configuration. For production use, consider using a more robust setup with multiple nodes and proper replication configurations.
:::


Navigate to `./drivers/mysql/config` (if building locally) OR just create a directory (say `OLAKE_DIRECTORY`) anywhere in your system if you want to use Dockerzied OLake and create these files:
1. `docker-compose.yml`
2. `source.json`
3. `destination.json` -> Refer the [additional-references](#additional-references) for details on writer file config.

## 1. Starting `docker-compose.yml` 

This compose file does the following:
- **Primary MySQL Service**: Runs a MySQL instance with CDC enabled.
- **Replication User Initialization**: Creates a user with replication privileges.
- **Data Loader**: Loads sample data into the MySQL instance.
- **Binlog Checker**: Verifies the existence and functionality of MySQL binary logs.
- **Network and Volume Configuration**: Sets up a custom network and persistent volume for MySQL data.

## 2. Starting MySQL

To start the MySQL container, run the following command from your project directory:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## 3. OLake Integration

Update your source configuration file (`source.json`) to connect to MySQL as follows:

```json title="source.json"
{
    "hosts": "host.docker.internal",
    "username": "root",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "main",
    "port": 3306,
    "update_method": {
      "intial_wait_time": 10
    },
    "tls_skip_verify": true,
    "default_mode": "cdc",
    "max_threads": 5,
    "backoff_retry_count": 4
}
```


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="build" label="Using Local build OLake" >

## 1. Copy the content from the above `docker-compose.yml` file to your local directory.

:::info
Clone the OLake repository if you want to build OLake locally, or skip to the part to use Dockerized OLake.

GitHub repository
```sh
git clone git@github.com:datazip-inc/olake.git
```
:::

## 2. Starting MySQL

To start the MySQL container, run the following command from your project directory:

```bash
docker compose -f ./drivers/mysql/config/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## 3. OLake Integration

Update your source configuration file (`source.json`) to connect to MySQL as follows:

```json title="source.json"
{
    "hosts": "localhost",
    "username": "root",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "main",
    "port": 3306,
    "update_method": {
      "intial_wait_time": 10
    },
    "tls_skip_verify": true,
    "default_mode": "cdc",
    "max_threads": 5,
    "backoff_retry_count": 4
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
Now that you are setup with a local database setup, head over to the [getting started guide](../../../getting-started/mysql#step-2-generate-a-streams-file) to start syncing data with OLake.
:::

## 4. Perform DDL and DML operations to test OLake (optional)
- **To check the status of the container, perform**:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
  This will list all running containers. Look for `primary_mysql` and `init_cdc_user` in the list.

- **Container Logs:**  
  Check container logs using to see if everything is working as expected:
  ```bash
  docker logs primary_mysql 
  ```


- **To bash into the MySQL container, perform**:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it primary_mysql /bin/bash
  ```

- **To access MySQL CLI, perform**:
  ```bash
  mysql -u root -p 
  ```

Enter the password when prompted, in this case, its `password` and then you can use any of the below commands to interract and sync data with again to see if updates, deletes, and inserts are working as expected.

```sql
SHOW DATABASES; // to list all databases
USE main; // to use a particular database
SHOW TABLES; // to see all the tables of selected database
DESCRIBE sample_table; // discover schema of a table
SELECT * FROM sample_table; // to view all the data of a particular table
INSERT INTO sample_table (name) VALUES ("sample_data_2"); // to insert data into a table
EXIT; // to quit the mysql session
```


## Check if binlogs are enabled

### Binary Logging Status:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';
```

Expect the value to be ON. If it’s OFF, binary logging is disabled.

### Binlog Format:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_format';
```

You should see ROW if CDC is configured correctly.

### GTID Mode:
```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'gtid_mode';
```

This should return ON.

### Check `binlog_row_metadata`:

It controls the amount of metadata written to the binary log when using row-based replication (--binlog-format=ROW). 

Check if the setting got enabled or not:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_row_metadata';
```

### Inspect a Binary Log

If you want to see the events written to the binlog, exit the MySQL shell and run the following command from your host (or inside the container):

```bash
docker exec -it primary_mysql mysqlbinlog /var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin.000001
```

This will print the contents of the first binary log file. Look for recent DML operations (like your INSERT statements) to confirm that changes are being logged.

### Check for Replication User and Permissions
If you’re using a CDC tool, ensure that the replication user was created properly. Back in the MySQL shell, run:

```sql
SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'cdc_user';
```

Then check its privileges with:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'cdc_user'@'%';
```

The replication user should have the REPLICATION SLAVE and REPLICATION CLIENT privileges.

In some edge cases you might need to pass in the below command.

```sql
SET GLOBAL binlog_row_metadata = 'FULL';
```

It controls the amount of metadata written to the binary log when using row-based replication (--binlog-format=ROW). After you change these settings, you may need to restart the docker container. 

Check if it got enabled or not:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_row_metadata';
```

## 5. Stop the Container

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="docker" label="Using Dockerized OLake" default>
- **To stop the container, perform**:

  ```bash
  docker compose down --remove-orphans -v
  ```
  This will stop and remove all containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, along with any orphaned containers and associated volumes.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="build" label="Using Local build OLake" >

- **To stop the container, perform**:

  ```bash
  docker compose -f ./drivers/mysql/config/docker-compose.yml down --remove-orphans -v
  ```
  This will stop and remove all containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, along with any orphaned containers and associated volumes.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

      

- **To remove the container, perform**:

  ```bash
  docker rm -f primary_mysql
  ```

  This will forcefully remove the specified container by its ID.

- **To remove the image, perform**:

  ```bash
  docker rmi -f IMAGE_ID
  ```
  This will forcefully remove the specified image by its ID.
