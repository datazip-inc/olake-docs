# Aurora MySQL CDC Setup Guide

Amazon Aurora MySQL (MySQL-compatible edition of Aurora) can be configured for CDC by enabling MySQL binary logging. Aurora MySQL does not have binary logging enabled by default for write scaling (unless read replicas are in use). To capture data changes, you must turn on binary logging with the appropriate format.

**Prerequisites:**

- An Amazon Aurora MySQL cluster (with a writer endpoint). Ensure the engine is MySQL (5.7 or MySQL 8.0 compatible).
- A custom **Cluster Parameter Group** for the Aurora cluster (since binlog settings are cluster-wide).
- Ability to reboot the Aurora cluster's writer instance to apply static parameter changes.
- The cluster should have **Backups enabled** (Aurora usually has continuous backups by default). This is important because binlog retention in Aurora is tied to backup retention; also we will set a retention via an RDS procedure.
- Willingness to accept a potential performance impact: enabling binary logging incurs additional I/O overhead ([Configuring Aurora MySQL binary logging - Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_LogAccess.MySQL.BinaryFormat.html#:~:text=Enabling%20binary%20logging%20increases%20the,CloudWatch%20metric)).

**Steps:**

1. **Enable Binary Logging and Row Format:** In the AWS RDS console, go to *Parameter Groups* and create a new **Cluster Parameter Group** for your Aurora MySQL cluster (choose the appropriate Aurora MySQL family, e.g., aurora-mysql5.7 or aurora-mysql8.0). Edit the cluster parameter group:
   - Set `binlog_format = ROW` ([How To: Set up a MySQL CDC connection on Amazon RDS](https://docs.decodable.co/howto/how-to-set-up-an-aws-aurora-mysql-cdc-connection.html#:~:text=Configure%20)) ([How To: Set up a MySQL CDC connection on Amazon RDS](https://docs.decodable.co/howto/how-to-set-up-an-aws-aurora-mysql-cdc-connection.html#:~:text=actions%2C%20and%20then%20choose%20Edit)). Row-based logging is required for CDC so that every data change is recorded as an event. (Aurora supports MIXED or STATEMENT formats too, but CDC tools rely on ROW format.)
   - Set `binlog_row_image = FULL`. This ensures the full before-and-after images of rows are logged. (FULL is the safest for CDC tools, capturing all columns. Minimal or NOBLOB images might omit unchanged columns; some CDC tools can handle minimal images, but FULL simplifies data completeness ([How To: Set up a MySQL CDC connection on Amazon RDS](https://docs.decodable.co/howto/how-to-set-up-an-aws-aurora-mysql-cdc-connection.html#:~:text=mysql,)).)
   - Ensure `log_bin` is effectively enabled. Aurora doesn't have an explicit `log_bin` parameter (it manages binlog internally). Setting `binlog_format` to any value other than OFF essentially enables `log_bin`. If there is a parameter `binlog_format = OFF` (which is possible to turn off binlog), we definitely want it ON (ROW).
   - (Optional) If you plan to use Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs) for replication consistency, also set `gtid_mode = ON` and `enforce_gtid_consistency = ON`. This can help if you have failovers or want to use GTID position for CDC resume. Aurora MySQL 5.7/8.0 do support GTID.
   - Save the parameter group changes.

   Associate this new cluster parameter group with your Aurora cluster: in the RDS console, modify the Aurora cluster to use the new cluster parameter group. Also ensure the instance parameter group (if separate) does not override these settings (Aurora MySQL’s binlog_format is cluster-level).

   - *Screenshot:* RDS Console showing the Aurora cluster’s parameter group with `binlog_format = ROW` and `binlog_row_image = FULL`.

2. **Reboot the Writer Instance:** Because `binlog_format` is static for the cluster, reboot the Aurora cluster’s primary instance (writer). After reboot, the binary log will start recording transactions. Verify the settings on the Aurora MySQL instance:
   ```sql
   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_format';
   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_row_image';
   ```
   They should show `ROW` and `FULL` respectively ([How To: Set up a MySQL CDC connection on Amazon RDS](https://docs.decodable.co/howto/how-to-set-up-an-aws-aurora-mysql-cdc-connection.html#:~:text=Verify%20CDC%20is%20enabled)) ([How To: Set up a MySQL CDC connection on Amazon RDS](https://docs.decodable.co/howto/how-to-set-up-an-aws-aurora-mysql-cdc-connection.html#:~:text=mysql,)). You can also check `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';` which should be "ON".

3. **Increase Binlog Retention Period:** By default, Aurora MySQL has a “lazy” binlog purge policy – it might keep around 24 hours of binlogs, or purge after a snapshot. To prevent losing changes if the CDC process lags or is down, set a longer retention. AWS provides an RDS procedure for Aurora MySQL:
   ```sql
   CALL mysql.rds_set_configuration('binlog retention hours', 168);
   ```
   This sets the binlog retention to the maximum of 168 hours (7 days) ([How To: Set up a MySQL CDC connection on Amazon RDS](https://docs.decodable.co/howto/how-to-set-up-an-aws-aurora-mysql-cdc-connection.html#:~:text=Configure%20binlog%20retention)). You can choose a lower number if 7 days of logs is too much, but 168 is the max. Confirm it by running:
   ```sql
   CALL mysql.rds_show_configuration;
   ```
   Look for the `binlog retention hours` setting in the output; it should show the value you set (e.g., 168) ([How To: Set up a MySQL CDC connection on Amazon RDS](https://docs.decodable.co/howto/how-to-set-up-an-aws-aurora-mysql-cdc-connection.html#:~:text=The%20maximum%20retention%20time%20is,03%20sec)). 

   Setting this ensures that if your CDC connector goes down, Aurora will keep up to 7 days of binlogs so you can catch up without data loss ([How To: Set up a MySQL CDC connection on Amazon RDS](https://docs.decodable.co/howto/how-to-set-up-an-aws-aurora-mysql-cdc-connection.html#:~:text=Configure%20binlog%20retention)). **Warning:** The cluster’s storage will grow with retained binlogs – monitor free space. Aurora usually has lots of IO capacity, but storage isn’t infinite. 7 days of binlogs for a busy system could be large.

   - *Screenshot:* A MySQL client screenshot after running `CALL mysql.rds_set_configuration('binlog retention hours', 168);` and `mysql.rds_show_configuration`, showing `binlog retention hours = 168`.

4. **Create a CDC (Replication) User:** It’s best not to use the master user for CDC. Create a dedicated user with replication privileges:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'cdc_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'strongpassword';
   GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'cdc_user'@'%';
   GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'cdc_user'@'%';
   ```
   - The `REPLICATION SLAVE` privilege allows the user to connect and fetch the binlog (even though this is Aurora, the privilege is named after MySQL’s replication).
   - `REPLICATION CLIENT` allows the user to see the master status and binlog events.
   - `SELECT ON *.*` is useful if the CDC tool needs to snapshot data from tables or perform any selects (Debezium will do an initial snapshot by default, hence read access is required).
   - In Aurora (and MySQL in general), you might also consider `SHOW VIEW` if your tables include views and the CDC needs them, and possibly `LOCK TABLES` if your CDC tool uses table locks for consistency. For example, to be safe, you could do:
     ```sql
     GRANT LOCK TABLES, RELOAD ON *.* TO 'cdc_user'@'%';
     ```
     Debezium’s MySQL connector by default does **not** use `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` (which requires RELOAD privilege) unless explicitly configured, but other tools might.
   - Flush privileges: `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`.

   Ensure `'%'` host or the specific host of your CDC server is allowed in the user definition. `'%'` is convenient for broad access (it means the user can connect from anywhere, assuming security group allows). If you want tighter security, specify the exact host or IP.

   - *Screenshot:* MySQL Workbench or CLI showing the new user and the GRANT statements executed (and maybe `SHOW GRANTS FOR 'cdc_user'@'%'` to confirm).

5. **Verify Binary Log is Active:** On the Aurora cluster, run:
   ```sql
   SHOW BINARY LOGS;
   ```
   You should see a list of binlog files (e.g., `mysql-bin-changelog.000001`, etc.) with file sizes. If you get an error **"you are not using binary logging"**, then binary logging is not yet active – double-check steps 1–2 (perhaps the parameter group didn’t apply or the reboot hasn’t occurred) ([What is default MySQL binlog retention in AWS RDS?](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/68272/what-is-default-mysql-binlog-retention-in-aws-rds#:~:text=rds_show_configuration,RDS%20MySQL%20transaction%20logs%3F%20Related)). 

   Also check:
   ```sql
   SHOW MASTER STATUS;
   ```
   This will show the current binlog file and position on the writer. This confirms that the binlog is tracking transactions.

   To further test, you can create a test table and insert a row:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE test_cdc (id INT PRIMARY KEY, val VARCHAR(100));
   INSERT INTO test_cdc VALUES (1, 'test');
   SHOW BINLOG EVENTS IN 'mysql-bin-changelog.000001' LIMIT 5;
   ```
   The `SHOW BINLOG EVENTS` should display some events including the insertion (if the limit covers it). This is just to sanity check that the events are indeed being logged.

6. **Connect the CDC Application:** Now configure your CDC tool (e.g., Debezium MySQL connector, AWS DMS task, etc.):
   - Use the **writer endpoint** of the Aurora cluster (Aurora’s cluster endpoint for writes). Do not use a reader endpoint for CDC, because read replicas in Aurora **do not have the full binlog** accessible; the binlog is generated on the writer and that’s where CDC must connect.
   - Connection details: host, port (3306), user = `cdc_user`, password.
   - The CDC tool will connect and perform an initial snapshot (unless turned off) and then start reading the binlog. Because we set `binlog_format=ROW` and `binlog_row_image=FULL`, the changes will be captured completely. 
   - If using Debezium, configure the connector with `include_schema_changes` if you want DDL changes, etc., and provide SSL parameters if your Aurora cluster requires SSL (RDS Aurora can be configured to require or not require SSL).
   - If the connector supports GTID and you enabled GTID, you can configure it to use GTID for positioning (Debezium has a `gtid.source.filter.dml.events` option, etc. – beyond scope here, but available).

   At startup, the connector might execute a `SHOW MASTER STATUS` to get the current binlog coordinates ([Add MySQL Database CDC source to an eventstream - Microsoft Fabric | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-source-mysql-database-change-data-capture#:~:text=2,to%20the%20user)), and then stream from there or from the beginning of available logs depending on configuration.

**Troubleshooting:**

- **No Binlog Files / “Not using binary logging”:** If `SHOW BINARY LOGS` returns empty or an error that binary logging is off, revisit the parameter group. Aurora MySQL requires a **cluster parameter group** change (instance-level param group won’t control binlog_format in Aurora; it must be cluster-level). Also ensure the cluster parameter group family is correct (Aurora MySQL 5.7 vs 8.0). After setting, you *must* reboot the cluster’s writer node ([How To: Set up a MySQL CDC connection on Amazon RDS](https://docs.decodable.co/howto/how-to-set-up-an-aws-aurora-mysql-cdc-connection.html#:~:text=6)).

- **Binlog_format remains MIXED:** Some Aurora MySQL versions default to MIXED. If after reboot you still see `binlog_format = MIXED`, it could be that the parameter group wasn’t applied or a conflicting parameter was set. Make sure no parameter sets it to MIXED in either cluster or instance param group. Set it explicitly to ROW in the cluster param group and reboot.

- **Binlog retention not honored:** If you find that binlogs are getting purged sooner than expected:
  - Confirm that automated backups are enabled. Aurora usually has continuous backup, but if someone disabled it or set retention to 0, the system might purge binlogs aggressively. AWS DMS documentation notes that enabling backups is necessary for CDC on RDS because the binary logs are retained between snapshots only when backups are on ([How To: Set up a MySQL CDC connection on Amazon RDS](https://docs.decodable.co/howto/how-to-set-up-an-aws-aurora-mysql-cdc-connection.html#:~:text=Enable%20automated%20backups)).
  - The `rds_set_configuration('binlog retention hours', N)` should keep logs up to N hours, but if disk space is low, the system might still purge to protect the instance. Monitor free space. Aurora can autoscale storage, but extremely large binlogs might impact performance.
  - You can call `mysql.rds_show_configuration` to see if the setting took effect ([How To: Set up a MySQL CDC connection on Amazon RDS](https://docs.decodable.co/howto/how-to-set-up-an-aws-aurora-mysql-cdc-connection.html#:~:text=The%20maximum%20retention%20time%20is,03%20sec)). If it shows `binlog retention hours | NULL` or not set, your call might not have executed or you lack permission. You need to be master user to call these procedures.

- **CDC user authentication issues:** If the CDC app cannot connect:
  - Verify the user and password by connecting manually (`mysql -u cdc_user -p -h cluster-endpoint`). If you can’t, check the grants (`SHOW GRANTS FOR 'cdc_user'@'%'`). Ensure the host in grants is correct (if your connector is connecting from an EC2 within the same VPC, '%' is fine; if connecting from outside, ensure the Aurora cluster is publicly accessible and security group open).
  - If using SSL, ensure the connector is set to use SSL (RDS provides certificates).
  - If connection times out, likely a VPC security group or networking issue (open port 3306 in SG, or use AWS PrivateLink/VPN if on-prem).
  
- **CDC user privilege issues:** If the connector complains about not being able to read the binary log or not having privileges:
  - Make sure `REPLICATION SLAVE` and `REPLICATION CLIENT` were granted ([How To: Set up a MySQL CDC connection on Amazon RDS](https://docs.decodable.co/howto/how-to-set-up-an-aws-aurora-mysql-cdc-connection.html#:~:text=The%20database%20user%20that%20connects,user%20and%20grant%20the%20roles)). Without these, the user cannot request the binlog stream or even do `SHOW MASTER STATUS`.
  - If the connector does an initial snapshot and you see errors selecting from tables, ensure the user has SELECT privileges as we granted.
  - If using Debezium and it’s performing a snapshot, it might attempt some `FLUSH TABLES` or similar if configured to lock. We granted `LOCK TABLES` and `RELOAD` just in case (RELOAD covers `FLUSH`). Debezium by default uses a non-locking snapshot (consistent read), so those might not be used. But if you see errors like “Access denied; you need (at least one of) the RELOAD privilege(s)”, you might consider granting RELOAD or adjust Debezium configs (e.g., set `snapshot.locking.mode` to none if you trust repeatable read).
  
- **Performance impact:** After enabling binlog, you might notice write throughput slightly impacted (higher IO, maybe a bit higher commit latency). This is expected ([Configuring Aurora MySQL binary logging - Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_LogAccess.MySQL.BinaryFormat.html#:~:text=Enabling%20binary%20logging%20increases%20the,CloudWatch%20metric)). Aurora is quite performant, but monitor the **Write IOPS** and **ReplicationLag** (even though no external replica, Aurora uses this internally too). Usually it’s fine, but if you see a big impact, consider instance class upgrade or ensure heavy batch jobs are not generating gigantic binlogs that saturate disk.

- **Failover handling:** If the Aurora cluster fails over to a replica (Aurora multi-AZ or multi-node will elect a new writer if the primary fails), your CDC connector will disconnect (since the writer endpoint now points to a new node). It should reconnect automatically to the cluster endpoint which will now route to the new writer. The binary log file name on the new writer will be different (Aurora will promote a read replica which has its own binlog series). If you have **GTID enabled**, this makes it seamless for the connector to continue via GTID position. If not using GTIDs, Debezium’s MySQL connector can still handle failover because Aurora’s replicas are in sync – Debezium will detect the new server and find the last known binlog position in the new server's binlog (Aurora ensures the replicas have same data, but binlog file names differ).
  - There might be a gap or overlap – Debezium uses an internal mechanism to reconcile this. It's a complex area, but the main thing is: enabling GTID on Aurora and in Debezium is recommended for robustness in failovers.

- **Monitoring:** Use CloudWatch metrics:
  - **BinLogDiskUsage** (RDS/Aurora metric) – how much space the retained binlogs use. This corresponds to our retention setting. If this grows near to the instance storage, consider reducing retention or ensure your CDC is catching up.
  - **DatabaseConnections** – the CDC connector will use one connection; just be mindful if you have a connection limit.
  - **FreeLocalStorage** – Aurora storage is ephemeral (distributed), but track it just in case.
  - The Aurora MySQL error log can also show messages if something is off, like “binlog overflow” or errors in replication.

By completing these steps, Aurora MySQL will be continuously pushing all data changes to its binary logs in row format. This allows a CDC consumer to reliably capture and replicate these changes onward (to a data lake, data warehouse, etc.). Aurora’s high performance and our retention configuration ensure even if the consumer is temporarily down, data changes are retained for a period.
