# Setup MongoDB Replica Set via Docker Compose (Local)
This guide explains how to spawn a MongoDB replica set using Docker Compose. It also covers instructions for ingesting sample data, and verifying the setup.

:::note
This compose file is not for production use. It is meant for local development and testing purposes only. It spawns a single MongoDB instance with a replica set configuration. For production use, consider using a more robust setup with multiple nodes and proper security configurations. 
:::



Navigate to `./drivers/mongodb/config` (if building locally) OR just create a directory (say `OLAKE_DIRECTORY`) anywhere in your system if you want to use Dockerzied OLake and create these files:
1. `docker-compose.yml`
2. `source.json`
3. `destination.json` -> Refer the [additional-references](#additional-references) for details on destination file config.

## 1. Starting `docker-compose.yml` for syncing Data with Dockerized OLake

This compose file does the following:
- **MongoDB Keyfile Generation**: Generates a keyfile for MongoDB authentication.
- **MongoDB Primary Node**: Sets up a primary MongoDB instance with a replica set configuration.
- **Data Loader**: Loads sample Reddit data into the MongoDB instance.
- **Network and Volume Configuration**: Defines a network for inter-container communication and a volume for persistent storage of the keyfile.
- **Health Checks**: Implements health checks to ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
- **Service Dependencies**: Ensures that the data loader waits for the MongoDB instance to be healthy before starting.
- **Custom Entry Points**: Uses custom entry points for the data loader to ensure it waits for the MongoDB instance to be ready before attempting to load data.

:::info
The `host.docker.internal` is used to refer to the host machine from within the Docker container. This is useful for connecting to services running on the host from within a container. If running on the local machine then replace `host.docker.internal` with `localhost`.

## 2. Starting MongoDB

To start the MongoDB container, run the following command from your project directory:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## 3. OLake Integration

Update your source configuration file (`source.json`) to connect to MongoDB as follows:

```json title="source.json"
{
  "hosts": ["host.docker.internal:27017"],
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password",
  "authdb": "admin",
  "replica-set": "rs0",
  "read-preference": "secondaryPreferred",
  "srv": false,
  "server-ram": 16,
  "database": "reddit",
  "max_threads": 5,
  "backoff_retry_count": 4
}

## 2. Starting MongoDB

To start the MongoDB container, run the following command from your project directory:

```bash
docker compose -f ./drivers/mongodb/config/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## 3. OLake Integration

Update your source configuration file (`source.json`) to connect to MongoDB as follows:

```json title="source.json"
{
  "hosts": ["localhost:27017"],
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password",
  "authdb": "admin",
  "replica-set": "rs0",
  "read-preference": "secondaryPreferred",
  "srv": false,
  "server-ram": 16,
  "database": "reddit",
  "max_threads": 5,
  "backoff_retry_count": 4
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
Now that you are setup with a local database setup, head over to the [streams configuration](/docs/install/docker-cli#streams-config) to start syncing data with OLake.
:::

## 4. Perform DDL and DML operations to test OLake (optional)
- **To check the status of the container, perform**:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
  
  This will list all running containers. Look for the `primary_mongo` container.

- **Container Logs:**  
  Check container logs to see if everything is working fine:
  
  ```bash
  docker logs primary_mongo
  ```

- **exec into MongoDB container:**  
  You can also exec into the MongoDB container to troubleshoot:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it primary_mongo /bin/bash
  ```

- **MongoDB Shell:**  
  You can use the MongoDB shell to perform DDL and DML operations. Connect to the MongoDB instance using:

  ```bash
  mongosh mongodb://admin:password@localhost:27017
  ```

### Some handy MongoDB commands

```sql
show dbs; -- to show the present databases
use reddit; -- to use a database named "reddit"
show collections; -- to show all the collections inside a chosen database
db.funny.insert({name: 'Red Delicious'}) -- add JSON data, here, "funny" is a name of a collection
db.funny.find().pretty() -- to list all the record of a collection
db.funny.updateOne(
  { _id: ObjectId("67ed7a7824c200a3fb300589") },
  { $set: { title: "hello mongodb" } }
);
db.funny.deleteOne({ _id: ObjectId("67e5c2e2bae4e0ab35d8b199") }) -- to delete one record
db.funny.deleteMany({}) -- to delete the entire "funny" collection
```

## 5. Stop the Container
- **To stop the container, perform**:

  ```bash
  docker compose -f ./drivers/mongodb/config/docker-compose.yml down --remove-orphans -v
  ```

OR

- **To stop the container, perform**:

  ```bash
  docker compose down --remove-orphans -v
  ```

depending upon the directory you are in.

This will stop and remove all containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, along with any orphaned containers and associated volumes.

- **To remove the container, perform**:

  ```bash
  docker rm -f primary_mongo
  ```

This will forcefully remove the specified container by its ID.

- **To remove the image, perform**:

  ```bash
  docker rmi -f IMAGE_ID
  ```
This will forcefully remove the specified image by its ID.
