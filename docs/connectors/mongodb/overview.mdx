# MongoDB Driver

The MongoDB Driver enables data synchronization from MongoDB to your desired destination. 

{/* <DocCardList/> */}
Below is an overview of the supported modes and writers for MongoDB data replication, along with tables summarizing the details.

### Supported Modes

Our replication process supports various modes to fit different data ingestion needs. 

The **Full Refresh** mode retrieves the entire dataset from MongoDB and is ideal for initial data loads or when a complete dataset copy is required. 

In contrast, **CDC (Change Data Capture)** continuously tracks and synchronizes incremental changes in real time, making sure that your destination remains updated with minimal latency. 

The **Incremental** mode is currently under development (WIP).

| Mode                          | Description                                                             |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Full Refresh**              | Fetches the complete dataset from MongoDB.                            |
| **CDC (Change Data Capture)** | Tracks and syncs incremental changes from MongoDB in real time.         |
| Incremental                   | No, WIP                                                                 |

### Supported Writers

OLake replicates data to multiple destinations to cater to a variety of deployment scenarios. 

Whether you're storing data locally for quick access or using cloud storage services like S3 for scalability, our system is designed to integrate seamlessly. 

We are also working on adding support for Iceberg to facilitate advanced analytics and data lake management.

## Setup and Configuration

To run the MongoDB Driver, configure the following files with your specific credentials and settings:

- **`config.json`**: MongoDB connection details.  
- **`catalog.json`**: List of collections and fields to sync (generated using the *Discover* command).  
- **`write.json`**: Configuration for the destination where the data will be written.

Place these files in your project directory before running the commands.

## Config File 
Add MongoDB credentials in following format in `config.json` file as shown [here.](./config#configjson-configuration)

### Commands

### Discover Command

The *Discover* command generates json content for `catalog.json` file, which defines the schema of the collections to be synced.

#### Usage
To run the Discover command, use the following syntax
   <LocalDiscoverMongoDB/>

## Catalog File 
After executing the Discover command, a `catalog.json` file is created. Read more about [Catalog File](./config#catalogjson-configuration) here.


## Writer File 

Read about about 
1. [Apache Iceberg Writer config](../../writers/iceberg/config)
2. S3 writer [here](../../writers/s3/overview)
3. [local writer](../../writers/local) 


### Sync Command

The *Sync* command fetches data from MongoDB and ingests it into the destination.

<LocalSyncMongoDB/>

To run sync with state:

<LocalSyncWithStateMongoDB/>

Find more about state file and its configuration [here.](./config#statejson-configuration)
