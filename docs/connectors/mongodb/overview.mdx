# MongoDB Driver

The MongoDB Driver enables data synchronization from MongoDB to your desired destination. 

{/* <DocCardList/> */}

## Supported Modes

1. **Full Refresh**  
   Fetches the complete dataset from MongoDB.

2. **CDC (Change Data Capture)**  
   Tracks and syncs incremental changes from MongoDB in real time.


## Setup and Configuration

To run the MongoDB Driver, configure the following files with your specific credentials and settings:

- **`config.json`**: MongoDB connection details.  
- **`catalog.json`**: List of collections and fields to sync (generated using the *Discover* command).  
- **`write.json`**: Configuration for the destination where the data will be written.

Place these files in your project directory before running the commands.

### Config File 
Add MongoDB credentials in following format in `config.json` file:

<MongoDBSourceConfig/>


## Commands

### Discover Command

The *Discover* command generates json content for `catalog.json` file, which defines the schema of the collections to be synced.

#### Usage
To run the Discover command, use the following syntax
   <LocalDiscover/>

#### Example Response (Formatted)
After executing the Discover command, `a catalog.json` file is created. Read more about [Catalog File](./catalog) here.






### Writer File 
The Writer file defines the configuration for the destination where data needs to be added.

`normalization` determine that Level 1 flattening is required. 
Example (For Local):
   ```json
   {
      "type": "PARQUET",
      "writer": {
         "normalization":true,
         "local_path": "./examples/reader"
      }
   }
   ```
Example (For S3):
  <S3Config/>

Read about about S3 writer [here](../../writers/s3/overview)

### Sync Command

The *Sync* command fetches data from MongoDB and ingests it into the destination.

<LocalSync/>

To run sync with state 

<LocalSyncWithState/>


### State File 
The State file is generated by the CLI command at the completion of a batch or the end of a sync. This file can be used to save the sync progress and later resume from a specific checkpoint.
#### State File Format
You can save the state in a `state.json` file using the following format.

<MongoDBStateConfig/>
