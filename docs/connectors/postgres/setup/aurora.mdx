# Aurora PostgreSQL CDC Setup Guide

Aurora PostgreSQL supports CDC through PostgreSQL logical decoding. In an Aurora cluster, CDC is enabled by turning on logical replication and using an output plugin like **wal2json** to stream changes. 

**Prerequisites:**

- An Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL cluster (PostgreSQL version 10+).
- Access to modify the cluster's parameter group (to enable logical replication).
- Ability to reboot the Aurora cluster (required for static parameter changes).
- A database user with superuser or replication privileges (e.g. the default `postgres` user or another user granted the `rds_superuser` role).

**Steps:**

1. **Enable Logical Replication in the Parameter Group:** In the AWS RDS console, create or edit the **cluster parameter group** for your Aurora PostgreSQL cluster. Set the parameter `rds.logical_replication` to `1` (true) ([Aurora PostgreSQL CDC Client](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/streamsets/6.x?topic=origins-aurora-postgresql-cdc-client#:~:text=To%20enable%20PostgreSQL%20logical%20replication,see%20the%20Amazon%20Aurora%20documentation)). This parameter enables logical replication and allows the use of logical decoding plugins like wal2json. Also ensure that `wal_level` is set to `logical` and that you have adequate `max_wal_senders` and `max_replication_slots` configured (enabling `rds.logical_replication` may automatically adjust `wal_level`, but double-check these settings) ([Performing logical replication for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL - Amazon Relational Database Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.LogicalReplication.html#:~:text=2.%20Set%20the%20,you%20are%20using%20logical%20slots)). Save the changes.

2. **Reboot the Cluster to Apply Changes:** `rds.logical_replication` is a static parameter, so reboot the Aurora cluster’s writer node to apply the new parameter group settings ([Replicating Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL data](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-data/5.1.x?topic=connections-replicating-amazon-rds-postgresql-data#:~:text=3,the%20Actions%20menu%2C%20select%20Reboot)). After reboot, you can verify the setting by running: 

   ```sql
   SHOW rds.logical_replication;
   ``` 

   It should return “on” (1) ([Replicating Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL data](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-data/5.1.x?topic=connections-replicating-amazon-rds-postgresql-data#:~:text=1,client%2C%20run%20the%20following%20query)).

3. **Create or Grant a Replication-Privileged User:** Use the master user (which has the `rds_superuser` role) or another user with sufficient privileges for CDC. Aurora’s default `postgres` user is an `rds_superuser` and has replication permissions by default ([Aurora PostgreSQL CDC Client](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/streamsets/6.x?topic=origins-aurora-postgresql-cdc-client#:~:text=Assign%20the%20Required%20Role)). If you prefer to use a different user, create one and grant it the required roles:
   
   ```sql
   CREATE USER cdc_user WITH PASSWORD 'strongpassword';
   GRANT rds_superuser TO cdc_user;
   -- (rds_superuser in Aurora automatically has logical replication permissions)
   ```
   
   Aurora PostgreSQL requires the CDC user to have superuser-level privileges (or at least the replication role) ([Aurora PostgreSQL CDC Client](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/streamsets/6.x?topic=origins-aurora-postgresql-cdc-client#:~:text=Reading%20WAL%20change%20data%20capture,granted%20with%20the%20superuser%20role)) ([Performing logical replication for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL - Amazon Relational Database Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.LogicalReplication.html#:~:text=1,you%27re%20using%20has%20these%20roles)). In Aurora, you cannot grant the literal `SUPERUSER` role, but `rds_superuser` is equivalent for permitted actions. Ensure this user can connect from your CDC client host (adjust security groups or VPC as needed).

4. **Verify the wal2json Plugin Availability:** Aurora PostgreSQL comes with the wal2json plugin pre-installed (enabling `rds.logical_replication` loads it). You can verify by creating a test logical replication slot using wal2json:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('test_slot', 'wal2json');
   ```
   
   This should succeed, returning a slot name and LSN if everything is configured. (If you get an error about the plugin not found, it means logical replication isn’t enabled or wal2json isn’t available – double-check step 1) ([Aurora PostgreSQL CDC Client](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/streamsets/6.x?topic=origins-aurora-postgresql-cdc-client#:~:text=To%20enable%20PostgreSQL%20logical%20replication,see%20the%20Amazon%20Aurora%20documentation)). You can list slots with `SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;` to confirm the slot exists.

5. **(Optional) Use the Slot to Stream Changes:** Although your CDC application will typically create and use its own slot, you can test manually. Make some data changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) in a test table, then use the SQL interface to fetch changes:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT data 
   FROM pg_logical_slot_get_changes('test_slot', NULL, NULL, 'pretty-print', '1');
   ```
   
   You should see JSON output from wal2json representing the recent transactions (one JSON per change or transaction) ([Logical replication and logical decoding - Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-logical#:~:text=%7B%20,a_table)) ([Logical replication and logical decoding - Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-logical#:~:text=,%7D)). This confirms that CDC is working. After testing, drop the test slot to avoid accumulating WAL: `SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('test_slot');`.

6. **Integrate with CDC Tool:** Configure your CDC tool (Debezium, etc.) to connect to the Aurora cluster endpoint with the `cdc_user` credentials. The tool should use a logical replication slot with plugin `wal2json`. You typically provide the plugin name in the connector config (e.g., Debezium Postgres connector `plugin.name=wal2json`). The tool may create a slot (for example, Debezium creates one named `debezium` or similar) if you don't pre-create it. Ensure the connector has the database name, user, password, host, and that it connects to the **writer instance** of Aurora (read replicas do not support creating logical slots on Aurora before Postgres 16).

   - *Screenshot:* (If applicable, a screenshot of the AWS RDS console **Database** > **Configuration** tab showing the cluster parameter group with logical replication enabled.)

**Troubleshooting:**

- **Permission Errors:** If you see `ERROR: permission denied to create replication slot` or the connector logs an authentication error for replication, it means the user lacks replication privileges ([Performing logical replication for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL - Amazon Relational Database Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.LogicalReplication.html#:~:text=1,you%27re%20using%20has%20these%20roles)). Use the master user or ensure your user has the `rds_superuser` (or at least `rds_replication`) role ([Performing logical replication for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL - Amazon Relational Database Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.LogicalReplication.html#:~:text=1,you%27re%20using%20has%20these%20roles)). On Aurora, using the default `postgres` user is simplest, since it already has the needed privileges ([Aurora PostgreSQL CDC Client](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/streamsets/6.x?topic=origins-aurora-postgresql-cdc-client#:~:text=Reading%20WAL%20change%20data%20capture,granted%20with%20the%20superuser%20role)).

- **Plugin Not Found:** If you get an error like `ERROR: could not access file "wal2json": No such file or directory` when creating a slot, the wal2json plugin is not enabled. This typically means `rds.logical_replication` is not set or not applied. Re-check the parameter group (step 1) and reboot. Enabling that parameter makes wal2json available on RDS/Aurora ([Aurora PostgreSQL CDC Client](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/streamsets/6.x?topic=origins-aurora-postgresql-cdc-client#:~:text=To%20enable%20PostgreSQL%20logical%20replication,see%20the%20Amazon%20Aurora%20documentation)).

- **No Changes Captured:** If the slot exists and the connector is running but no changes are coming through:
  - Verify that `wal_level` is indeed **logical** on the Aurora instance (you can `SHOW wal_level;` to confirm).
  - Ensure the table you are changing is in a replication-enabled database (in Postgres, logical decoding is per database). The connector should connect to the specific database where the changes occur.
  - Check the replication slot statistics: run `SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;`. If the slot’s `active` column is `f` (false), the connector isn’t actually connected. If `active` is `t` but `restart_lsn` isn’t advancing, the connector might be stuck or not processing events.
  - Make sure your CDC tool is using the wal2json plugin (and not expecting `pgoutput`). For example, Debezium’s config should not use `pgoutput` in this context.

- **WAL Retention and Bloat:** Logical replication slots will retain WAL segments on the cluster until they are consumed. If a slot is not actively read, the WAL will pile up and can eventually fill storage ([Logical replication and logical decoding - Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-logical#:~:text=You%20must%20monitor%20logical%20decoding,longer%20used%2C%20drop%20it%20immediately)). On Aurora, monitor the “Write-Ahead Log consumption” or free storage. If your connector falls far behind or is stopped, you may see disk usage grow or even an error in the database logs about WAL retention. To resolve, resume consumption or if the slot is no longer needed, drop it. **Always drop unused logical slots** ([Logical replication and logical decoding - Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-logical#:~:text=You%20must%20monitor%20logical%20decoding,longer%20used%2C%20drop%20it%20immediately)).

- **Replica Identity Issues:** PostgreSQL requires a primary key (or other replica identity) on tables to capture UPDATE/DELETE properly. If a table has no primary key and you have not set `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`, deleting or updating rows can cause logical decoding to skip or not output those changes. If you see messages about **“no replica identity”** or missing information for some changes, consider setting `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` on those tables:
  
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE my_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
  ```
  
  This will include the full before-image of rows in WAL for tables without a primary key, ensuring wal2json can output the changes.

- **Network Connectivity:** If the CDC application cannot connect at all, check the Aurora cluster’s **security group**. The Aurora instance must allow inbound connections from your CDC client (open the PostgreSQL port, default 5432). A screenshot of the **VPC security group rules** (allowing the client's IP) can be helpful.
  
  - *Screenshot:* Security Group inbound rule allowing PostgreSQL access, if explaining network setup issues.

With Aurora PostgreSQL configured as above, you have logical decoding streaming changes via wal2json. This sets the stage for feeding those changes into downstream systems (data warehouses, Kafka, etc.) in a reliable, low-latency manner.
