# Setup Postgres Replica Set via Docker Compose (local)
This guide explains how to spawn a Postgres replica set using Docker Compose. It also covers instructions for ingesting sample data, and verifying the setup.


:::note
This compose file is not for production use. It is meant for local development and testing purposes only. It spawns a single Postgres instance with a replica set configuration. For production use, consider using a more robust setup with multiple nodes and proper replication configurations.
:::

:::info
Clone the OLake repository if you want to build OLake locally, or skip to the part to use Dockerized OLake.

GitHub repository
```sh
git clone git@github.com:datazip-inc/olake.git
```

### Enable wal2json

To enable the `wal2json` plugin, you need to add the following line to the `postgresql.conf` file:

```conf
wal_level = logical
max_wal_senders = 10
max_replication_slots = 10
```
:::


Navigate to `./drivers/postgres/config` (if building locally) OR just create a directory (say `olake-docker`) anywhere in your system if you want to use Dockerzied OLake and create these files:
1. `docker-compose.yaml`
2. `config.json`
3. `writer.json` -> Refer the [additional-references](#additional-references) for details on writer file config.

      # 4. Start Postgres with additional configuration parameters:
      #    - wal_level=logical: Enable logical replication.
      #    - max_wal_senders=10: Allow up to 10 concurrent WAL sender processes.

## 2. Starting Postgres

To start the Postgres container, run the following command from your project directory:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## 3. OLake Integration

Update your source configuration file (`config.json`) to connect to Postgres as follows:

```json title="config.json"
{
    "host": "host.docker.internal",
    "port": 5431,
    "database": "main",
    "username": "main",
    "password": "password",
    "jdbc_url_params": {},
    "ssl": {
        "mode": "disable"
    },
    "update_method": {
        "replication_slot": "postgres_slot",
        "intial_wait_time": 10
    },
    "reader_batch_size": 100000,
    "default_mode": "cdc",
    "max_threads": 50
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="build" label="Using Local build OLake" default>


## 2. Starting Postgres

To start the Postgres container, run the following command from your project directory:

```bash
docker compose -f ./drivers/postgres/config/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

## 3. OLake Integration


Update your source configuration file (`config.json`) to connect to Postgres as follows:

```json title="config.json"
{
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5431,
    "database": "main",
    "username": "main",
    "password": "password",
    "jdbc_url_params": {},
    "ssl": {
        "mode": "disable"
    },
    "update_method": {
        "replication_slot": "postgres_slot",
        "intial_wait_time": 10
    },
    "reader_batch_size": 100000,
    "default_mode": "cdc",
    "max_threads": 50
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now that you are setup with a local database setup, head over to the [getting started guide](../../../getting-started/postgres#step-2-generate-a-catalog-file) to start syncing data with OLake.

- **To stop the container, perform**:

  ```bash
  docker compose down --remove-orphans -v
  ```

## Additional References

- **Configuration Files:**  
  Refer to the following documentation for configuration details:
  1. [`config.json`](../../../core/configs/source)
  2. [`catalog.json`](../../../core/configs/catalog)
  3. [`writer.json`](../../../core/configs/writer)
  4. [`state.json`](../../../core/configs/state)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following:

- **Container Logs:**  
  Check container logs for Postgres using:
  
  ```bash
  docker logs CONTAINER_ID 
  ```

- **To bash into the Postgres container, perform**:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
  ```

  ```bash
  psql -h localhost -U main
  ```

Enter the password when prompted, in this case, its `password`

and then you can use any of the below commands to interract.

```
\l; // to list all databases
\c <db_name> // to switch to other database
\dt // // to see and list all the tables of selected database
\d <table-name> // describe the table schema
\du // to list users and their roles
```

## Enable Logical Replication Settings via SQL

Instead of modifying postgresql.conf, use SQL commands to apply runtime settings (if your Postgres setup allows it):

```sql
-- Enable logical WAL level 
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'logical';  
-- Set max replication slots and senders 
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = 4; 
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_wal_senders = 4;  
-- Apply the changes 
SELECT pg_reload_conf(); 
```

Note: Some cloud-hosted databases (like RDS or Cloud SQL) require you to modify these settings via the provider’s console or parameter groups.

### Grant Replication Permissions

If you are using separate role for OLake with name “olake_user”,  ensure this user has the required privileges:

```sql
ALTER ROLE olake_user WITH REPLICATION; 
```

Or you can use any other Superuser or role with Replication permissions. 

### Create a Logical Replication Slot

OLake reads changes via a logical replication slot. Create one using:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('olake_slot', 'wal2json'); 
```

This slot starts tracking changes from the current WAL position, allowing OLake to stream inserts, updates, and deletes.
