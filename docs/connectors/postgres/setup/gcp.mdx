# Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL CDC Setup Guide

Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL supports CDC through logical replication using the native `pgoutput` plugin and PostgreSQL publications. The service provides managed PostgreSQL with built-in support for logical decoding.

**Prerequisites:**

- Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance (PostgreSQL version 10+)
- `cloudsqlsuperuser` privileges (default `postgres` user)
- Access to Google Cloud Console for configuration
- TLS enabled if connecting directly

:::info Read Replica Support
**PostgreSQL 16+:** Google Cloud SQL supports logical replication on read replicas, but with limitations. Row deletions and vacuum operations on the primary may invalidate logical replication slots on read replicas, causing inconsistencies.

**PostgreSQL 15 and earlier:** Read replicas cannot act as publishers for logical replication. Use the **primary instance** for CDC functionality.

**Recommendation:** For production CDC workloads, connect OLake to the **primary instance** to avoid potential slot invalidation issues.
:::

**Steps:**

1. **Enable Logical Decoding:** In Google Cloud Console, navigate to your Cloud SQL instance and enable the logical decoding flag:

   1. Go to **Cloud SQL** → Select your instance
   2. Click **Edit** → **Flags**
   3. Add flag: `cloudsql.logical_decoding = on`
   4. **Save** and **Restart** the instance

   ![gcp-logical-decoding](/img/docs/cdc/postgres/gcp-logical-decoding.webp)

   Verify the setting after restart:
   ```sql
   SHOW cloudsql.logical_decoding;
   ```

2. **Configure Network Access:** Set up connectivity for OLake:

   **Option A: Direct Connection (Requires TLS)**
   1. Go to **Connections** → **Networking**
   2. Click **Add network**
   3. Add OLake's IP addresses with `/32` CIDR
   4. **Save** the configuration

   **Option B: Private IP**
   Configure Private Service Connect or VPC peering for secure connectivity.

3. **Create Replication User:** Connect as `cloudsqlsuperuser` (usually `postgres`) and create a dedicated CDC user:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER cdc_user WITH PASSWORD 'strongpassword';
   ALTER ROLE cdc_user WITH REPLICATION;
   ```

   :::info Superuser Requirements
   The `postgres` user in Cloud SQL has `cloudsqlsuperuser` privileges, which includes replication permissions by default.
   :::

   **Optional: Read-only Access for Initial Snapshot**

   Grant explicit read permissions for stricter security:

   ```sql
   -- Example for the "public" schema in database mydb
   GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO cdc_user;
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO cdc_user;
   GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO cdc_user;
   -- Ensure future tables are covered automatically
   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO cdc_user;
   ```

4. **Create Publication and Replication Slot:** Create a publication and optionally a pgoutput slot for testing:

   :::important Slot Name Configuration
   Use the **exact replication slot name** that you configure in OLake UI or CLI. The slot name must match the `replication_slot` parameter in your OLake source configuration.
   :::

   ```sql
   -- Create publication for all tables
   CREATE PUBLICATION olake_publication FOR ALL TABLES WITH (publish = 'insert,update,delete,truncate');
   -- For partitioned tables on PostgreSQL 13+:
   -- CREATE PUBLICATION olake_publication FOR ALL TABLES WITH (publish = 'insert,update,delete,truncate', publish_via_partition_root = true);
   -- Replace 'your_olake_slot_name' with the slot name from your OLake configuration
   SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('your_olake_slot_name', 'pgoutput');
   ```

   **Verify Configuration:**
   ```sql
   -- Check replication slots
   SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;
   ```

5. **Test Replication:** Verify that CDC is working correctly with pgoutput:

   ```sql
   -- Create test data
   INSERT INTO test_table (data) VALUES ('GCP CDC test');
   
   -- Add the table to publication and peek binary changes
   ALTER PUBLICATION olake_publication ADD TABLE test_table;
   SELECT lsn, xid, encode(data,'hex') AS data_hex
   FROM pg_logical_slot_peek_binary_changes(
     'your_olake_slot_name', NULL, NULL,
     'proto_version','1',
     'publication_names','olake_publication'
   );
   ```

   ✅ **Success:** Returns binary change records from pgoutput  
   
   Best practices:
   - Create the publication before creating the slot
   - Create the slot in the same database as your OLake connection
   - Use a unique slot name per connection; slot names cannot start with a number
   ❌ **Permission denied:** Check user has `REPLICATION` role


Now that you have configured the Google Cloud database and created the CDC user, you can add the PostgreSQL source in OLake to build an ELT pipeline to Iceberg or Parquet. See the [PostgreSQL connector overview](/docs/connectors/postgres/overview) for a high-level walkthrough.

## Troubleshooting

- **Flag Not Applied:** If `cloudsql.logical_decoding` shows as `off` after restart, verify that:
  - You're connected to the correct database instance
  - The flag was saved before restarting
  - The instance has fully restarted (check Cloud SQL logs)

- **Permission Errors:** If you see `ERROR: permission denied to create replication slot`:
  - Use the `postgres` user (which has `cloudsqlsuperuser` role)
  - Ensure the user has `REPLICATION` privileges: `ALTER ROLE user WITH REPLICATION;`
  - Verify the user can connect to the specific database

- **Network Connectivity:** If OLake cannot connect:
  - Check that the instance has a **public IP** or proper **private connectivity**
  - Verify **authorized networks** include OLake's IP addresses
  - Ensure **SSL/TLS** is configured if required
  - Test connectivity: `telnet your-instance-ip 5432`

- **Replication Slot and Publication Issues:**
  - Slot names cannot start with numbers
  - Each OLake connection needs a unique slot name
  - Ensure a publication exists and includes your tables (`SELECT * FROM pg_publication;`)
  - Monitor slot lag: `SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;`

- **Read Replica Limitations:**
  :::caution Read Replica Requirements
  Logical replication on read replicas requires PostgreSQL 16+. For earlier versions, connect OLake to the primary instance only.
  :::

- **WAL Retention:** Monitor storage usage as inactive replication slots retain WAL files:
  - Set up **Cloud Monitoring** alerts for disk usage
  - Drop unused slots: `SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot('slot_name');`
  - Consider setting `max_slot_wal_keep_size` to prevent runaway storage growth

- **Statement Timeout:** Ensure `statement_timeout` is `0` or greater than 5 minutes to avoid interrupting long-running snapshot queries.

- **SSL Configuration:** Cloud SQL enforces SSL by default. If connecting directly:
  - Use `sslmode=require` in connection strings
  - For client certificates, use `sslmode=verify-full`
  - Download the server CA certificate if needed

Google Cloud SQL provides a robust managed PostgreSQL service with comprehensive CDC capabilities. The platform handles most operational concerns while providing the flexibility needed for real-time data integration.
