### PostgreSQL → Apache Iceberg Connector Benchmark

_(OLake vs. Popular Data-Movement Tools)_

#### 1. Speed Comparison – **Full-Load Performance**

| Tool               | Rows Synced | Throughput (rows / sec) | Relative to OLake    |
| ------------------ | ----------: | ----------------------: | -------------------- |
| **OLake**          |  **4.01 B** |          **46,262 RPS** | –                    |
| Fivetran           |      4.01 B |              46,395 RPS | Parity (≤1 % faster) |
| Debezium (memiiso) |      1.28 B |              14,839 RPS | **3.1 × slower**     |
| Estuary            |      0.34 B |               3,982 RPS | **11.6 × slower**¹   |
| Airbyte            |      12.7 M |                 457 RPS | **101 × slower**     |

¹ _Estuary ran the same 24-hour window but processed a \~10× smaller dataset, so its throughput looks even lower when normalized._

:::info
1. The time elapsed for all the tools was 24 hours, but OLake, Debezium, Estuary and Fivetran were able to process the entire dataset in that time. Airbyte faield with a sync after 7.5 hours, so we only have throughput for the first part of the test.
:::

**Key takeaway:** OLake sustains the same top-tier bulk-load speed as Fivetran while outpacing every other open-source option by 3-to-100×.

#### 2. Speed Comparison – **Change-Data-Capture (CDC)**

| Tool               |   CDC Window | Throughput (rows / sec) | Relative to OLake |
| ------------------ | -----------: | ----------------------: | ----------------- |
| **OLake**          | **22.5 min** |          **36 982 RPS** | –                 |
| Fivetran           |       31 min |              26,910 RPS | **1.4 × slower**  |
| Debezium (memiiso) |       60 min |              13,808 RPS | **2.7 × slower**  |
| Estuary            |        4.5 h |               3,085 RPS | **12 × slower**   |
| Airbyte            |         23 h |                 585 RPS | **63 × slower**   |

:::info
The rows synced in the CDC test were the same 50 million changes that OLake processed in 22.5 minutes. The other tools were tested on the same dataset, but they had different CDC windows (timings).
:::

**Key takeaway:** For incremental workloads OLake leads the pack, moving 50 million PostgreSQL changes into Iceberg **40 % faster than Fivetran** and **10-60× faster than other OSS connectors**.

#### 3. Cost Comparison (Vendor List Prices)

| Tool          | Scenario        |                                                                           Spend (USD) |  Rows Synced | **Cost / 1 M Rows** |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | -----------: | ------------------: |
| **OLake**     | Full Load / CDC | Cost of a `Standard D64ls v5 (64 vcpus, 128 GiB memory)` running for 24 hours `< $75` | 4.01 B / 50M |                   - |

| Airbyte Cloud | CDC             |                                                                             \$ 148.95 |         50 M |             \$ 2.98 |

- **OLake** is open-source and can be deployed on your own Kubernetes cluster or cloud VMs; you pay only for the compute and storage you provision.

### What These Numbers Mean for You

- **Peak throughput without lock-in:** OLake matches or beats proprietary SaaS speeds while letting you keep data and infrastructure in your own account.
- **Superior CDC latency:** Faster change propagation means fresher downstream analytics and near-real-time feature generation for ML.
- **Predictable TCO:** Because OLake is self-hosted, you scale resources up or down to hit your desired SLA at the lowest cloud cost—no opaque credit systems.
- **Resource profile:** In these tests OLake used 57.6 GB RAM (roughly one `Standard D64ls v5 (64 vcpus, 128 GiB memory)` VM) for both full-load and CDC runs; adjust sizing linearly with your workload.

> **Bottom line:** If you need to land terabytes of PostgreSQL data into Apache Iceberg quickly—and keep it continually up-to-date—OLake delivers enterprise-grade speed without the enterprise-grade bill.
