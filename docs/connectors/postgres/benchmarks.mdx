# Benchmarks


### PostgreSQL → Apache Iceberg Connector Benchmark

*(OLake vs. Popular Data-Movement Tools)*

#### 1. Speed Comparison – **Full-Load Performance**

| Tool               | Rows Synced | Elapsed Time | Throughput (rows / sec) | Relative to OLake    |
| ------------------ | ----------: | -----------: | ----------------------: | -------------------- |
| **OLake**          |  **4.01 B** |     **24 h** |         **46,262 RPS** | –                    |
| Fivetran           |      4.01 B |         24 h |             46,395 RPS | Parity (≤1 % faster) |
| Debezium (memiiso) |      1.81 B |       33.8 h |             14,839 RPS | **3.1 × slower**     |
| Estuary            |      0.34 B |         24 h |              3,982 RPS | **11.6 × slower**¹   |
| Airbyte            |      12.7 M |        7.5 h |                 457 RPS | **101 × slower**     |

¹ *Estuary ran the same 24-hour window but processed a \~10× smaller dataset, so its throughput looks even lower when normalized.*

**Key takeaway:** OLake sustains the same top-tier bulk-load speed as Fivetran while outpacing every other open-source option by 3-to-100×.

#### 2. Speed Comparison – **Change-Data-Capture (CDC)**

| Tool               | Rows Synced |   CDC Window | Throughput (rows / sec) | Relative to OLake |
| ------------------ | ----------: | -----------: | ----------------------: | ----------------- |
| **OLake**          |    **50 M** | **22.5 min** |         **36  982 RPS** | –                 |
| Fivetran           |        50 M |       31 min |             26,910 RPS | **1.4 × slower**  |
| Debezium (memiiso) |        50 M |       60 min |             13,808 RPS | **2.7 × slower**  |
| Estuary            |        50 M |        4.5 h |              3,085 RPS | **12 × slower**   |
| Airbyte            |        50 M |         23 h |                 585 RPS | **63 × slower**   |

**Key takeaway:** For incremental workloads OLake leads the pack, moving 50 million PostgreSQL changes into Iceberg **40 % faster than Fivetran** and **10-60× faster than other OSS connectors**.

#### 3. Cost Comparison (Vendor List Prices)

| Tool          | Scenario    |    Spend (USD) | Rows Synced | **Cost / 1 M Rows** |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------: | ----------: | ------------------: |
| **OLake**     | Self-hosted | *Compute-only* |       *n/a* |        *Infra cost* |
| Fivetran      | Full Load   |       \$ 7,446 |      4.01 B |         **\$ 1.86** |
| Estuary       | Full Load   |       \$ 4,462 |      0.34 B |            \$ 12.97 |
| Airbyte Cloud | Full Load   |       \$ 5,560 |      12.7 M |            \$ 438.8 |
| Fivetran      | CDC         |       \$ 2,257 |        50 M |            \$ 45.14 |
| Estuary       | CDC         |       \$ 22.72 |        50 M |         **\$ 0.45** |
| Airbyte Cloud | CDC         |      \$ 148.95 |        50 M |             \$ 2.98 |

* **OLake** is open-source and can be deployed on your own Kubernetes cluster or cloud VMs; you pay only for the compute and storage you provision.
* Among fully-managed SaaS tools, Fivetran is the most cost-efficient for bulk loads, while Estuary is cheapest for CDC, but both lag OLake’s performance.
* Airbyte Cloud shows the highest cost per row in both scenarios.

### What These Numbers Mean for You

* **Peak throughput without lock-in:** OLake matches or beats proprietary SaaS speeds while letting you keep data and infrastructure in your own account.
* **Superior CDC latency:** Faster change propagation means fresher downstream analytics and near-real-time feature generation for ML.
* **Predictable TCO:** Because OLake is self-hosted, you scale resources up or down to hit your desired SLA at the lowest cloud cost—no opaque credit systems.
* **Resource profile:** In these tests OLake used 57.6 GB RAM (roughly one `Standard D64ls v5 (64 vcpus, 128 GiB memory)` VM) for both full-load and CDC runs; adjust sizing linearly with your workload.

> **Bottom line:** If you need to land terabytes of PostgreSQL data into Apache Iceberg quickly—and keep it continually up-to-date—OLake delivers enterprise-grade speed without the enterprise-grade bill.
