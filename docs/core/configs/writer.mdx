OLake supports two writer modes for exporting your database data in Parquet format:

1. Local Parquet Writer
2. S3 Writer
3. Iceberg Writer (coming soon)

Before proceeding with either configuration, please ensure you have completed the [getting started](../../getting-started/overview.mdx) instructions for the database you want to connect from. For more background details, refer to the [README section](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/blob/master/README.md).

## S3 Writer 

OLake’s Parquet S3 writer allows you to write your data directly into an Amazon S3 bucket in Parquet format. This mode is ideal for users who want to leverage S3’s scalable storage for their data outputs.

## Local Parquet Writer 

The local writer mode is used to write Parquet files directly to a local directory inside your Docker container. The local directory is mapped to your host file system via a Docker volume. To run OLake via docker, follow [getting started](../../getting-started/overview.mdx) guide.
