# Architecture

OLake’s architecture is designed for efficient, scalable data replication from operational databases to data lakehouses. Key components include:

- **Core Framework** : Orchestrates data flow, managing configuration, concurrency, and state for seamless operations.

- **Drivers** : Connect to source databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle), supporting full refresh, incremental and real-time change data capture (CDC).

- **Writers** : Handle destinations like Apache Iceberg and Parquet, enabling robust analytics and schema evolution.

- **Protocol Layer** : Provides standardized interfaces for modularity and extensibility.

- **Type System** : Manages schema evolution and data type conversions for compatibility.

- **Performance Optimizations** : Leverages database-specific chunking, parallel processing, and adaptive concurrency for high throughput.
