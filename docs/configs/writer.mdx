# `writer.json`

OLake supports two writer modes for exporting your database data in Parquet format:

1. Local Parquet Writer
2. S3 Writer
3. Iceberg Writer (coming soon)

Before proceeding with either configuration, please ensure you have completed the [getting started](../getting-started) instructions. For more background details, refer to the [README section](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/blob/master/README.md).



## 1. Local Parquet Writer 

The local writer mode is used to write Parquet files directly to a local directory inside your Docker container. The local directory is mapped to your host file system via a Docker volume. To run OLake via docker, follow [getting started](../getting-started) guide.

### Sample Configuration

```json
{
  "type": "PARQUET",
  "writer": {
    "normalization": false,
    "local_path": "/mnt/config"
  }
}
```

### Configuration Key Details

| **Key**                   | **Data Type** | **Example Value**               | **Description & Possible Values**                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **type**                  | string        | `"PARQUET"`                     | Specifies the output file format. Currently, only the Parquet format is supported.                                                                                                               |
| **writer.normalization**  | boolean       | `false`                         | Determines whether OLake applies level-1 JSON flattening to nested objects. Set to `true` if you require normalized output; otherwise, use `false`.                                             |
| **writer.local_path**     | string        | `"/mnt/config"`                 | The local directory inside the Docker container where Parquet files will be stored. This path is mapped to your host file system via a Docker volume.                                           |

> **Note:** This configuration enables the Parquet local writer. For more details, check out the [README section](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake/blob/master/README.md).



## 2. S3 Writer 

OLake’s Parquet S3 writer allows you to write your data directly into an Amazon S3 bucket in Parquet format. This mode is ideal for users who want to leverage S3’s scalable storage for their data outputs.

### Sample Configuration

```json
{
  "type": "PARQUET",
  "writer": {
    "normalization": false,
    "s3_bucket": "olake-s3-test",
    "s3_region": "ap-south-1",
    "s3_access_key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "s3_secret_key": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "s3_path": "/data"
  }
}
```

### Configuration Key Details
For Configuration and other details regarding S3, refer to [S3 writer docs](../writers/s3).

## 3. Data Partitioning

While not directly configured in `writer.json`, data partitioning is an important aspect of how your data is organized when written to storage. For more details on partitioning strategies (especially when using S3), please refer to the [S3 partitioning documentation](./s3#s3-data-partitioning).



## 4. Upcoming Features: Iceberg Writer

The Iceberg writer is an upcoming feature, expected to be released by the end of February 2025. Stay tuned for updates and further documentation on its configuration and usage.
