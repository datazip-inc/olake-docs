# `state.json`

The `state.json` file is a critical component in OLake's synchronization process. It tracks the point (via a cursor token, resume token, or offset) until which data has been processed. This mechanism allows OLake to resume syncing from where it left off, preventing duplicate processing of records.


## File Structure

A typical `state.json` file has the following structure:

```json title="config.json"
{
  "type": "STREAM",
  "streams": [
    {
      "stream": "stream_8",
      "namespace": "otter_db",
      "sync_mode": "",
      "state": {
        "_data": "8267B34D61000000022B0429296E1404"
      }
    },
    {
      "stream": "stream_0",
      "namespace": "otter_db",
      "sync_mode": "",
      "state": {
        "_data": "8267B34D61000000022B0429296E1404"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Components

| **Key**   | **Data Type** | **Description**             | **Sample Value**                                |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **`type`**  | string        | Identifies the type of state stored. Typically, it is set to `"STREAM"`.                                                                           | `"STREAM"`                                      |
| **`streams`** | array       | An array containing state objects for each stream.                                                                                                | `[ { ... }, { ... } ]`                           |
| **`stream`**| string        | The unique identifier for the stream whose state is recorded.                                                                                      | `"stream_8"` or `"stream_0"`                      |
| **`namespace`** | string    | The namespace or logical grouping the stream belongs to.                                                                                           | `"otter_db"`                                    |
| **`sync_mode`** | string     | Indicates the active synchronization mode for the stream. This value may be empty or contain a specific mode.                                         | `""` (empty string)  or sync modes like `"cdc"`, `"full_refresh"`, `"incremental"` (WIP)                            |
| **`state`** | object        | Contains the resume token or offset. This token determines the point until which data has been synced.                                               | `{ "_data": "8267B34D61000000022B0429296E1404" }` |

## How It Works

- **Resume Token / Offset:**  
  The value stored in the `state` object (in the `_data` field) represents the cursor token, resume token (in MongoDB), or offset (in other databases) indicating the last processed record.  
- **Incremental Syncing:**  
  By keeping track of the token, OLake can start the next sync run from this point, ensuring that previously processed records are not re-fetched.
- **Multiple Streams:**  
  Each stream in the `streams` array maintains its own synchronization state. This allows OLake to handle multiple data sources or partitions independently.


## Benefits

- **Efficiency:**  
  Incremental synchronization reduces data transfer and processing by only fetching new or changed records.
- **Data Consistency:**  
  Tracking the synchronization state prevents duplicate processing, ensuring that data remains consistent.
- **Flexibility:**  
  The state mechanism supports various data sources (e.g., MongoDB with resume tokens, other databases with offsets), making it adaptable to different backend systems.
