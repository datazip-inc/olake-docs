# Customer Story Images

This directory contains placeholder images for customer story cards on the Customers page.

## Required Images

The following images need to be created with a **dark blue overlay** (matching Ollama brand color #193ae6):

1. `cordial-cover.webp` - For Cordial customer story (B2B category)
2. `astro-talk-cover.webp` - For Astro Talk customer story (Customers category)
3. `fintechcorp-cover.webp` - For FinTechCorp customer story (Fintech category)
4. `dataflow-cover.webp` - For DataFlow Inc. customer story (B2B category)
5. `paysecure-cover.webp` - For PaySecure customer story (Fintech category)

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: WebP (preferred) or PNG
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (recommended for card display)
- **Overlay**: Dark blue gradient overlay (#193ae6) applied to images
- **Size**: Optimized for web (recommended: 1280x720px or similar)
- **Company Logo**: Company name should be visible in white text at bottom-left of image (handled by CSS overlay)

## Design Notes

- Images should be professional and relevant to each company's industry
- The dark blue overlay will be applied via CSS, but images should work well with the overlay
- Company logos/names are overlaid via CSS, so base images don't need to include them

## Current Status

⚠️ **Placeholder images are needed** - The customer cards will display but images need to be added to this directory.
