\u0026 - will be converted to & in the folder name

note that if you column values have data that contain '/' by any change, partition is going to get affected by it. The system will generate addional nested folders for them.

For ex - 

| title |
| --- | 
| Hi/my name is / priyansh|

will genrate the following partition folder

```
Hi/my name is/priyansh/423878fsd87fsd78XXXXXX.parquet
```

and not 

```
Hi/my name is/priyansh/423878fsd87fsd78XXXXXX.parquet
```

Show the above in dir structure format.

Which all types of timestamp do we parse in partition?
