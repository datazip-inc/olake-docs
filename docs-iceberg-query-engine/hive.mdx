# Apache Hive
Apache Hive is a data warehouse software built on top of Hadoop. It provides an SQL-like interface to query and manage large datasets stored in Hadoop's HDFS. Hive supports various file formats, including Parquet, ORC, and Avro, making it compatible with Iceberg tables.

Hive can be used to query Iceberg tables, allowing users to leverage its SQL capabilities for data analysis. It supports partitioning, schema evolution, and time travel features of Iceberg, making it a powerful tool for managing large datasets in a Hadoop environment.
