The year is 2025, and the data engineering landscape has never been more exciting—or more confusing. Walk into any tech conference, and you'll hear buzzwords flying around like "lakehouse," "Delta Lake," "Iceberg," and "unified analytics." But beneath all the marketing noise lies a fundamental question that keeps data architects awake at night: **Which platform can actually deliver on the promise of fast, reliable, cost-effective analytics at scale?**

To answer this question, we embarked on the most comprehensive benchmark we could design: 1TB of industry-standard TPC-H data, 8.6 billion rows, and two of the most talked-about platforms in modern data engineering going head-to-head in an epic performance showdown.

This isn’t another vendor shootout. We’re comparing two different takes on data architecture—one with UC Berkeley roots, one from Netflix’s open‑source world—to see how they perform in practice.

Buckle up. We're about to dive deep into the technologies that are reshaping how the world thinks about data.

## Chapter 1: The Genesis Stories - How Giants Are Born

### Databricks: From Academic Research to Enterprise Dominance

Born out of UC Berkeley’s AMPLab, Spark set out to make distributed computing actually usable. In 2013, its creators launched Databricks to turn that power into something teams could run day to day—first as managed Spark, then as a full platform.

Highlights, at a glance:

- 2013–2015: Managed Spark + notebooks.
- 2016–2018: Cluster automation, collab notebooks, early MLflow.
- 2019–2021: Delta Lake brings ACID, schema enforcement, time travel.
- 2022–2025: Unity Catalog, Photon, tighter AI/LLM workflows.

Net-net: Databricks evolved from “Spark‑as‑a‑service” into a unified analytics platform focused on speed, reliability, and usability.

### Apache Iceberg: The Open Source Rebellion

While Databricks doubled down on an integrated platform, Netflix, Apple, and LinkedIn hit classic data‑lake pain: tiny files, slow planning, brittle schema changes—and growing discomfort with vendor lock‑in.

How Iceberg showed up:

- 2017: Netflix kicked off Iceberg to fix those fundamentals.
- 2018–2019: Open‑sourced to Apache; Apple and LinkedIn joined.
- 2020–2021: Built for multi‑engine use (Spark, Flink, Trino/Presto, etc.).
- 2022–2025: Rapid adoption across clouds and tooling.

At its core, Iceberg stands for open, interoperable data architecture you can move across systems without rewriting everything.

## Chapter 2: Technical Deep Dive - The Architecture That Powers Performance

When we talk about TPC-H benchmarking at 1TB scale, we're not just comparing query engines—we're comparing entire data ecosystems. The real performance story lies in how each architecture handles the complete journey from source data ingestion to final query execution. In the case of Databricks, its tightly integrated Delta Lake foundation plays a key role in how data is stored, optimized, and queried. Let's examine how both architectures orchestrate this complex dance of data movement, storage optimization, and compute execution.

Checkout feature level differences in following blog **Apache Iceberg VS Delta Lake**. Read our guide: [Apache Iceberg vs Delta Lake: Ultimate Guide for Data Lakes](/blog/apache-iceberg-vs-delta-lake-guide).

### Databricks: The Integrated Performance Machine

The Databricks approach represents a vertically integrated philosophy where every component is designed to work seamlessly with every other component. Think of it as a Formula 1 racing team where the engine, chassis, and aerodynamics are all custom-built to work together.

![Databricks Architecture](/img/blog/2025/10/arch_Databricks.png)

**Stage 1: Data Ingestion and Landing**

The journey begins with PostgreSQL as our source system. Databricks connects to PostgreSQL through a JDBC connector, establishing a straightforward yet efficient data pipeline to Delta Lake. The transfer mechanism is deliberately simple: data flows in batches of 200,000 rows at a time.

**Stage 2: Delta Lake - The Smart Landing Zone**

This is where Databricks shows its architectural sophistication. As TPC-H data lands in Delta Lake, the engine automatically optimizes the storage layout through **optimized writes and auto-compaction**, merging small files into larger, well-sized Parquet files to reduce metadata overhead and improve query performance.

**Stage 3: The Compute Layer**
When TPC-H queries execute, the Databricks Runtime orchestrates a sophisticated execution strategy:

- **Adaptive Query Execution:** Real-time query plan adjustments based on actual data distribution

- **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Clusters scale compute resources based on query complexity and data volume

- **Adaptive Partition Coalescing:** Specifically merges small shuffle partitions post-shuffle to reduce task overhead and improve parallelism balance.

### Apache Iceberg: The Federated Architecture Approach

The Iceberg architecture takes a fundamentally different approach—instead of tight integration, it achieves performance through open standards and intelligent metadata management. In our benchmark setup, **OLake** serves as the critical bridge between PostgreSQL and the Iceberg ecosystem.

![Iceberg Architecture](/img/blog/2025/10/arch_Iceberg.png)


**Stage 1: OLake-Powered Data Ingestion**

The journey begins with OLake as the data movement engine. OLake isn't just another EL tool—it's specifically designed for high-performance data lake ingestion with Iceberg optimization.

**Stage 2: Iceberg Table Creation and Optimization**

This is where Iceberg’s design efficiency comes into play. As data lands in Iceberg tables, it automatically maintains metadata and organizes files into an optimized layout, pruning unnecessary reads and ensuring consistent query performance without manual tuning.

**Stage 3: AWS Glue Catalog Integration**

The AWS Glue Catalog acts as a universal metadata layer, enabling seamless table discovery and interoperability for our query engine Spark.

**Stage 4: Spark Query Execution**

While Iceberg supports seamless query access from multiple engines such as Trino, Flink, and Spark, for an apples-to-apples comparison with Databricks, we used **Spark on AWS EMR** as the query layer. The setup leveraged adaptive query execution (AQE), skew join handling, and partition coalescing for runtime optimization.

## Chapter 3: The Benchmark Design


Benchmarks only matter if they look like real work. We used the industry‑standard TPC‑H suite at the 1TB scale—about **8.66B rows** spread across 8 tables—and ran all 22 queries sequentially on both platforms.

- **What we ran:** The exact 22 TPC‑H queries, unmodified.
- **How we ran them:** Same dataset, same scale, same order, measured to the second.
- **Why it’s fair:** Identical source data and equivalent cluster profiles on each side.

What TPC‑H actually stresses:
- Multi‑table joins and planning under skew
- Predicate/partition pruning and scan efficiency
- Heavy aggregations, group‑bys, and rollups
- Subqueries, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS patterns, and selective filters
- Ordered outputs, top‑N, and window‑style workloads

Why this design matters:
- It captures the mix of quick lookups and long, complex reports most teams run daily.
- It reveals not just raw speed, but how each system prunes, caches, joins, and schedules work under pressure.

## Chapter 4: The Battle Begins

### A. The Battlefield Setup

To ensure a true **apples‑to‑apples** comparison, both environments were provisioned with equivalent resources, identical connector parameters, and their recommended destination‑side optimizations.

**1. The source and the compute configurations:**

| **Component** | **Deatils** |
|---------------|-------------|
    | Source | Azure PostgrSQL |
| Compute | 32 vCPU, 128GB RAM |

**2. The Data Ingestion configuration:**

    | **Environment** | **Deatils** |
    |---------------|-------------|
    | Databricks | n2-standard-32 (32 vCPU, 128 GB RAM) |
    | OLake | Standard_D32s_v6 (32 vCPU, 64 GB RAM) |

**3. The Query Execution configuration:**
    | **Environment** | **Deatils** |
    |---------------|-------------|
    | Databricks | - Master node: n2-standard-32 (32 vCPU, 128 GB RAM)<br/> - Worker nodes: 1-3x n2-standard-16 (16 vCPU, 64 GB RAM) |
    | Iceberg | - Master node: m6g.8xlarge (32 vCPU, 128 GB RAM)<br/> - Core nodes: 1-3x m6g.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 64 GB RAM) |


### B. Data Transfer 

Before we can benchmark query performance, we need to get our 1TB of TPC-H data into both systems efficiently. 

Moving 8.66 billion rows from PostgreSQL to analytical platforms isn't trivial. Traditional ETL tools often struggle with this scale, creating bottlenecks that can take hours or even days to resolve. The performance of data ingestion directly impacts how fresh your analytical insights can be—a critical factor in today's real-time business environment.

**1. Databricks (Using JDBC)**

For our Databricks implementation, we used a straightforward approach that prioritizes reliability over maximum throughput. This conservative strategy reflects real-world production constraints where stability often takes precedence over raw speed.

**Our Implementation Approach:**

- **Single JDBC Connection:** One dedicated connection stream to prevent overwhelming the PostgreSQL source

- **Fixed Batch Size:** Consistent 200,000-row batches was chosen as optimal batch size to maintain memory usage after testing on different batch sizes. 

- **Single Write Operations:** Each batch written individually to Delta Lake, ensuring transaction integrity

- **Sequential Processing:** Linear data flow from source to destination without complex parallelization

:::tip[Note]
We enabled **Delta’s Auto Optimize and Auto Compactio**n features to automatically merge small files and improve write performance without manual intervention.

**Why This Conservative Approach?**

When we initially attempted to parallelize the data transfer using multiple concurrent JDBC connections, we hit a wall of technical constraints that made the simple sequential approach far more practical.

**The Core Issues:**

- **Memory and GC Pressure:** Eight parallel tasks meant eight JDBC connections and eight batch buffers in memory simultaneously. This exceeded our 128 GB node's capacity, triggering aggressive garbage collection pauses (10-30 seconds) that froze all tasks, timed out connections, and forced retries.

- **Source Database Throttling:** Multiple concurrent readers exhausted PostgreSQL's connection slots and created I/O contention on the source, slowing all parallel reads.

Sequential writes with a single JDBC connection proved faster and more reliable. Each **200K-row batch** maintained stable resource usage—no contention, no memory pressure, no unexpected timeouts.

**Memory Utilization:**

![Memory Utilization for Data Transfer](/img/blog/2025/10/delta_dump_memory.png)

The cluster maintained memory utilization between **46-93 GB** throughout the data transfer process, with very low swap usage. This indicates that the 128 GB RAM instance was sufficient to handle the PostgreSQL to Delta Lake data ingestion efficiently, with most data processing happening in memory rather than relying on disk-based swap.

**CPU Usage:**

![CPU Usage for Data Transfer](/img/blog/2025/10/delta_dump_cpu.png)

The CPU utilization remained extremely low **(near 0%)** throughout the entire data transfer period from PostgreSQL to Iceberg. This was due to the sequential transfer approach rather than parallel processing, which meant that the 32 vCPU capacity was not utilized to its limit.

**2. Iceberg (Using OLake)**

For the Iceberg path, we leveraged **OLake**, an open-source data replication tool specifically optimized for high-throughput data lake ingestion.

**OLake's Advantage:**

- Delivers high throughput through parallelized data chunking, resumable historical snapshots, and lightning-fast incremental updates, ensuring exactly-once reliability even at massive scale.
- OLake's setup is really simple and UI-driven, which made our data ingestion process much easier. Instead of spending time writing and optimizing code like in traditional ETL tools, we just configure everything through OLake’s intuitive interface which is extremely user friendly.

:::tip[Important to Know!]
In our runs, OLake was configured with `max_threads=32` for ingestion parallelism.
:::

**Memory Utilization:**

```sql
"system_memory_used_gb": {
    "min": 4.023582458496094,
    "max": 61.19172668457031,
    "mean": 49.14759881837982,
    "count": 8628
}
```

- The system memory usage ranged from a minimum of 4.02 GB to a maximum of 61.19 GB, with an average of 49.15 GB throughout the transfer process. This indicates that the 128GB RAM instance was sufficient. 
- We could have increased the parallel processing by increasing the number of threads, and still would have been within the 128GB RAM limit. The optimal memory usage has been observed here on the OLake's side.

**CPU Usage:**

```sql
"cpu_usage_percent": {
    "min": 0.14021625333129503,
    "max": 97.88296172040852,
    "mean": 93.47998879565941,
    "count": 8628
  }
```

The CPU usage ranged from 0.14% to 97.88%, with an average of 93.48% throughout the transfer process. This indicates that OLake maintained consistently high CPU utilization during the data ingestion, suggesting that the tool was actively processing data at a very high rate.

**Comparing both the approaches:**

When comparing our two data transfer approaches from local PostgreSQL to their destinations—Databricks Delta tables via a single-stream JDBC pipeline and Iceberg on S3 via a high‑throughput OLake pipeline—we observed clear differences in speed, operational effort, and cost, along with meaningful trade‑offs in reliability and flexibility.

| **Dimensions** | **Databricks** | **OLake** |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Transfer Time | 25.7 hours | ~12 hours |
| Transfer Cost | n2-standard-32($1.55/hr) = **~$39** | Standard_D32s_v6 (32 vCPU, 64 GB RAM)($1.61/hr) = **~$20** |
| Operational Comfort | Tedious | Extremely Simple |


The transfer time clearly shows the difference—one method took around 25 hours, while the other finished in less than half that time.

Time and cost move together in data engineering—longer runs mean higher bills. OLake’s high throughput reduces runtime and, by extension, infrastructure cost. Plus, OLake is open source, so you’re only paying for the compute and storage you choose to provision.

The final question is comfort: **How effortless is it for a data engineer to get from “connect” to “complete”?** 

- On Databricks, we wrote extensive Python—managing source/target connections, selecting tables, and building a custom transfer pipeline—powerful, but undeniably tedious for bulk loads. 

- With OLake, the workflow was point‑and‑click: enter source and destination configs, select tables, hit Sync, and watch progress. It’s the kind of setup where you can watch a movie and eat pizza while the data moves—because that's how easy it is!

### C. Running TPCH queries 

With our 1TB dataset successfully loaded into both platforms, the real test begins. This is where architectural decisions, query optimization strategies, and compute orchestration converge into raw performance numbers. Over the course of our benchmark, we executed all 22 TPC-H queries sequentially on both platforms, measuring execution time down to the second.

**Important benchmarking note:** To keep the comparison apples-to-apples, we aimed to run the same Spark TPC-H code on both platforms. On the Iceberg side, we observed minor difficulties and adjusted accordingly:

1) With 64 shuffle partitions, we encountered **memory pressure (OOM)** and failures, so we set partitions to 128.

2) We had to turn off vectorized reading due to an Arrow **"Buffer index out of bounds"** error (when processing certain Parquet pages with DOUBLE columns, the Arrow buffer allocation logic did not size the buffer correctly, creating a 0‑byte buffer when ~40KB was required). Because of this, we switched to non‑vectorized reading, which definitely affects the speed to query the data.

**Code used to run the TPC-H queries for Databricks:**

**The results are as follows:**

![TPCH Query Results](/img/blog/2025/10/tpch_query_result.png)

**The Overall Picture**

When the dust settled after running 8.6 billion rows through 22 complex analytical queries, the headline numbers told an interesting story:

- **Databricks Total Time:** 11,163.94 seconds (186.07 minutes / 3.1 hours)

- **Iceberg Total Time:** 9,132.47 seconds (152.21 minutes / 2.54 hours)

- **Time Difference:** 2,031.47 seconds (33.86 minutes)

- **Overall Improvement:** Iceberg finished **18.2% faster**

Breaking Down Performance by Query Category

To understand what drives these performance differences, we need to look beyond individual query times and examine how each platform handles different categories of analytical workloads.

![TPCH Query Results by Category](/img/blog/2025/10/query_by_cat.png)

The table below provides the time taken by respective environments to finish specific query category of the TPCH queries:

| **Query Category** | **Databricks** | **Iceberg** | **Conclusion** | 
|---------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Simple Aggregations <br/>(Q1, Q6) | 10.18 minutes | 4.29 minutes | **Iceberg is 57.9% faster.** |
| Complex Multi-Table Joins<br/>(Q5, Q7, Q8, Q9) | 11.95 minutes | 10.73 minutes | **Iceberg is 10.2% faster.** |
| Subquery-Heavy Analytics<br/>(Q2, Q11, Q17, Q20) | 9.48 minutes | 3.76 minutes | **Iceberg is 60.3% faster.** |
| Group By & Aggregations<br/>(Q3, Q4, Q10, Q12, Q13) | 5.55 minutes | 5.56 minutes | **Databricks is 0.2% faster.** |
| Ordering & Top-N Queries<br/>(Q15, Q18, Q21) | 15.33 minutes | 15.84 minutes | **Databricks is 3.3% faster.** |

Analyzing the performance across various query categories, it’s evident that Iceberg not only excels in overall performance but also significantly outperforms Databricks in most individual categories. In the few cases where Databricks does perform better, the margin is minimal and the results are quite close.

**Memory Utilization:**

Beyond query performance metrics, analyzing memory utilization patterns on both platforms is equally important to understand how effectively each environment leverages its provisioned resources during workload execution.

**1. Databricks:**

![Memory Utilization for TPCH](/img/blog/2025/10/delta_tpch_memory.png)

The cluster maintained a stable memory utilization between ~35–55 GB during the TPCH query execution. 

**2. Iceberg:**

![Memory Utilization for TPCH](/img/blog/2025/10/iceberg_tpch_memory.png)

The cluster spiked at first and then maintained a stable memory utilization during the complete TPCH query execution.

**The Complexity Hypothesis: Where Does Each Platform Excel?**

If your workload mainly involves **simple, fast queries, Databricks** is the better choice — it consistently delivers quicker results for lightweight operations.

However, if you’re running **complex, long-running queries, Iceberg** clearly takes the lead, performing about **38% faster** on average.

## Chapter 5: The Cost of Performance

Raw query execution time tells only part of the performance story. In cloud environments where you pay for every compute hour, resource efficiency matters as much as speed. A faster query that consumes significantly more resources may actually cost more to run—but as we'll see, that's not what happened here.

Our benchmark revealed a fascinating outcome: **Iceberg finished 18.2% faster AND cost 83% less to run.** Let's break down the numbers.

:::tip[IMPORTANT TO KNOW]
Databricks used **2 worker nodes** throughout the benchmark, while Iceberg utilized all **3 core nodes** from start to finish. This configuration difference—**2 workers vs 3**—might suggest higher resource consumption for Iceberg, but the actual cost story is dramatically different.

### Cost Analysis: The Surprising Winner

**1. Databricks Total Cost: $56.33**

 - **i. Data Transfer Cost:**
   - n2-standard-32 (@ $1.55/hr): $1.55 × 25.7 hours = $39
   - 1 node × 0.4 DBU/hr × $0.55/DBU × 25.7 hours = $5.65

 - **ii. TPCH Query Execution Cost:**
   - GCP Compute Cost: $9.63
     - Master node (n2-standard-32 @ $1.55/hr): $1.55 × 3.10 hours = $4.80
     - Worker nodes (2x n2-standard-16 @ $0.78/hr each): $0.78 × 2 × 3.10 hours = $4.83
   - Databricks Platform Fee (DBUs):
     - 3 nodes × 0.4 DBU/hr × $0.55/DBU × 3.10 hours = $2.05

**2. Iceberg Total Cost: $21.95**  

 - **i. Data Transfer Cost:**
   - Standard_D32s_v6 (@ $1.61/hr): $1.61 × 12 hours = $20

 - **ii. TPCH Query Execution Cost:**
   - **AWS EMR Cost (EC2 + EMR fees included):** $1.95
     - Master node (m6g.8xlarge) @ $0.308/hr: $0.308 × 2.54 hours = $0.78
     - Core nodes (m6g.4xlarge) (3x @ $0.154/hr each): $0.154 × 3 × 2.54 hours = $1.17

**The Verdict:** Iceberg cost **$34.38 less** per benchmark run—that's **61% cheaper** than Databricks while delivering **18.2% faster** execution.

### Production Impact: When Small Differences Become Big Numbers

For a single benchmark run, the $34.38 difference feels negligible. But extrapolate to production workloads, and the math becomes compelling:

Processing 1TB of TPC-H-equivalent analytics daily we can get to see the numbers increasing drastically.

| **Platform** | **Daily** | **Monthly** | **Yearly** |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Databricks | $56.33 | $1689.90 | **$20,278.80** |
| Iceberg | $21.95 | $658.50 | **$7,902.00** |

**Annual Savings with Iceberg: $12,376.80**

**These numbers assume you're running the exact benchmark "once" daily!** Real-world workloads vary, but the magnitude of the cost difference remains.

## Chapter 6: The Verdict

Considering both the cost and time taken for transferring data from the source to the destination, as well as executing the TPC-H benchmark queries, the comparative results are summarized below:

| **Metric** | **Databricks** | **Iceberg + OLake** | **Conclusion** |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Data Transfer Speed | 25.7 hours | 12 hours | **OLake is 2.1x faster.** |
| Data Transfer Cost | $39 | $20 | **OLake is 49% cheaper.** |
| TPC-H Query Speed | 186 minutes | 152 minutes | **Iceberg is 22% faster.** |
| TPC-H Query Cost | $11.68 | $1.95 | **Iceberg is 83% cheaper.** |
| Total Cost | $50.71 | $21.96 | **Iceberg+OLake is 57% cheaper.** |
| Total Time | 28.8 hours | 14.53 hours | **Iceberg+OLake is 49.55% faster.** |

Overall, when evaluating both environments across the critical dimensions of cost efficiency, transfer speed, and query performance, the results indicate a clear operational advantage for one setup in terms of both time and monetary investment. These findings establish a strong baseline for future scalability and optimization decisions.

### The Honest Assessment

Databricks' unified platform genuinely does reduce operational complexity. Managing Spark clusters, Glue Catalogs, and S3 configurations requires expertise that many teams don't have. That operational complexity has real cost.

But if your team can manage that complexity—or if you use managed services like AWS Glue or Databricks' own Iceberg support—**Iceberg's 61% cost advantage combined with 18.2% faster end-to-end execution creates a compelling case.**

The choice isn't about which platform is "better." It's about which trade-off aligns with your constraints: simplicity vs. efficiency, unified integration vs. cost optimization, managed convenience vs. hands-on control.

For now, our benchmark gives you data to inform your decision. Test with your actual workloads, evaluate your team's expertise, and choose the platform that unblocks your business.

Because the best data platform isn't the fastest or cheapest—it's the one your team can successfully operate that delivers business value.
