Hi! 👋

I've updated the compaction blog post with a few SEO improvements:

**Title change:**
- Updated to: "How to Compact Apache Iceberg Tables: Small Files + Automation with Apache Amoro"

**Added 3 high-intent keywords:**
1. "Iceberg table maintenance" (Section 1.3)
2. "rewrite_data_files" and "Iceberg OPTIMIZE" (Section 4.1)
3. "rewrite_manifests" and "remove_orphan_files" (Section 5.5)

All changes have been pushed to the `compaction_blog` branch. The keywords are naturally integrated into the existing content without changing the meaning or tone.

Thanks! 🙏
