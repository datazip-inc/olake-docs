            <p>A party may terminate these Terms for cause: (i) upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period, or (ii) immediately if the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p>

            <p>In the event that the Receiving Party believes that returning or destroying Confidential Information is not feasible, the Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party in writing of the condition that makes return or destruction infeasible. If the Disclosing Party agrees that return or destruction of the Confidential Information is infeasible, as determined in its sole discretion, the Receiving Party will extend the protection of confidentiality under Section 6 to such Confidential Information and limit further disclosure of such Confidential Information for so long as the Receiving Party maintains such Confidential Information.</p>
