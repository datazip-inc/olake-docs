  "summary": "The community meetup focused on recent developments and features within the OLake ecosystem, with participants sharing their experiences and insights. Priyansh Khodiyar provided an overview of new functionalities, including a faster target writer for normalization, a new stats file for performance metrics, and the implementation of Docker Compose for MongoDB replica sets. He highlighted the introduction of the Split Vector Strategy, which allows users to fetch data based on chunk size or timestamp, and encouraged attendees to review the extensive documentation available for these updates. Further discussions included the addition of MySQL and Postgres as data sources in OLEC, driven by user demand. Shubham Baldava elaborated on the Iceberg Writer, currently integrated with the Debezium Iceberg Server for schema evolution, and noted that its basic features include upserts and concurrency improvements with future enhancements planned. The conversation shifted to CDC implementation strategy, where a write-ahead log approach is favored. Tushar Kesarwani proposed a federated cataloging system to manage multiple Glue catalogs efficiently, and Shubham agreed to explore it further. Additionally, Pankaj Kaushik introduced the idea of integrating blockchain technology for immutable data transaction records. Priyansh concluded the meetup with a demo on MongoDB replica sets and data syncing, urging community members to contribute to documentation and share feedback on schema evolution challenges in Iceberg.",
