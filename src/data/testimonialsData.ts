    title: 'Custom Logic & Monitoring',
    description:
      "We have a pretty unique environment with hundreds of Mongos routers, so no off-the-shelf solution was ever going to handle that magically. With OLake, we added a bit of custom logic and light monitoring, and it's been completely hands-off since. It saved us from building yet another bespoke sync system, and now we're even thinking about near real-time syncs because OLake makes that realistically achievable.",

    title: '100x Reduction in Ingestion Volume',
    description:
      "One of the first and most visible outcomes was the dramatic drop in data movement for problematic collections. This reduction came from OLake's efficient handling of delta changes and conversion to parquet directly from source.",
