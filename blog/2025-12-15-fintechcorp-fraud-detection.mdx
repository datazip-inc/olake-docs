# FinTechCorp accelerates fraud detection with real-time data pipelines

**FinTechCorp**, a financial technology company, needed to build a real-time fraud detection system that could analyze transactions as they occurred. Their existing batch-based approach was too slow, allowing fraudulent transactions to go through before detection.

## The Challenge

FinTechCorp's fraud detection system needed to:
- Process transactions in real-time (sub-second latency)
- Reduce false positives to improve customer experience
- Scale to handle millions of transactions per day
- Integrate with multiple data sources for comprehensive fraud analysis

## The Solution

FinTechCorp implemented OLake to build real-time fraud detection pipelines:

1. **Real-time CDC**: Set up change data capture from transaction databases to analytics systems
2. **Streaming Analytics**: Enabled real-time processing of transaction data for immediate fraud detection
3. **Multi-Source Integration**: Combined data from multiple sources (transactions, user profiles, historical patterns) for comprehensive analysis
4. **Apache Iceberg Storage**: Stored historical transaction data in Iceberg format for pattern analysis and model training

## Results

- **35% reduction** in false positives
- **50% improvement** in fraud detection speed
- **90% reduction** in fraudulent transaction processing time
- **2x increase** in transaction volume capacity

## Technical Implementation

FinTechCorp used OLake's CDC capabilities to stream transaction data in real-time to their fraud detection analytics platform. The data was stored in Apache Iceberg format, enabling both real-time analysis and historical pattern recognition for improved fraud detection accuracy.
