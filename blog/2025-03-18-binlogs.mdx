### What Are Binlogs?
Binary logs in MySQL are files that log all changes made to your database. These logs record every operation that modifies data (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements). They don’t log `SELECT` statements or other read-only operations.

Binary logs in MySQL are a feature that allows the recording of all changes made to the database in a structured binary format. The binary log files contain a chronological record of SQL statements or row-level changes that modify the data in the database. They are primarily used for tasks such as replication, point-in-time recovery, auditing, and data analysis.


### Why Do We Need Binlogs?
- **Replication:** Binlogs are essential for MySQL replication, where one database (the master) copies its data to one or more other databases (the slaves). The master records every change in the binlog, and the slaves replay those changes to stay in sync.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery:** If your database crashes or you accidentally delete some data, binlogs can help you restore your database to the exact state it was in at a specific time, just before the problem occurred.
- **Auditing and Data Analysis:** You can analyze binlogs to see exactly what changes were made and when. This can be useful for auditing purposes or tracking down when and how data was modified.

### How Do Binlogs Work?
1. **Recording Changes:**
   When you make a change to the database, MySQL first writes that change to the binlog before applying it to the database. This ensures that the change is logged even if the database crashes right after the operation.

2. **Log Structure:**
   The binlog doesn’t just store the raw SQL commands. Instead, it stores a more efficient, binary-encoded version of the operations. This might be the exact SQL statement or the specific row-level changes, depending on your binlog format (which can be statement-based, row-based, or mixed).

3. **Binlog Files:**
   The changes are stored in a series of binlog files, each with a sequential number. As changes accumulate, new files are created. You can configure how often new binlog files are generated and how long they are retained.

4. **Replication:**
   If you have replication set up, the slave servers read these binlog files and apply the changes to their own databases. This keeps them in sync with the master server.

5. **Recovery:**
   In case you need to recover data to a specific point in time, you can use the binlogs to "replay" all the changes up to that exact moment. This allows you to restore your database to a precise state before a problem occurred.


#### Question: Do binlogs store only the sql commands? or the data from database itself as you said it can be used if we want recovery ?

Great question! Binlogs in MySQL can store different types of information depending on the binlog format you choose: **statement-based**, **row-based**, or **mixed**. Let's break down what this means.

### 1. Statement-Based Logging:
- **What It Stores:** Only the SQL commands themselves.
- **How It Works:** When you make a change to the database, MySQL logs the actual SQL statement (e.g., `UPDATE users SET age = 30 WHERE id = 5;`). During replication or recovery, MySQL will re-execute this SQL statement on the slave server or during recovery.
- **Advantages:** It uses less space because it only logs the statements.
- **Disadvantages:** Some statements can behave differently on the slave if the data isn't exactly the same, leading to potential inconsistencies.

### 2. Row-Based Logging:
- **What It Stores:** The actual data changes made to each row.
- **How It Works:** Instead of logging the SQL statement, MySQL logs the exact changes to each row. For example, if the SQL command `UPDATE users SET age = 30 WHERE id = 5;` is executed, the binlog will store that the `age` field for the row with `id = 5` was changed from `25` to `30`.
- **Advantages:** It's more precise because it logs the exact data changes, which ensures consistency across replicas, regardless of the data state on the slave.
- **Disadvantages:** It uses more space because it logs every row change.

### 3. Mixed Logging:
- **What It Stores:** A combination of both statement-based and row-based logs.
- **How It Works:** MySQL decides on a case-by-case basis whether to log the SQL statement or the actual row changes. For example, it might use statement-based logging for simple updates but switch to row-based logging for more complex operations that might not replicate correctly with just the SQL command.
- **Advantages:** Provides a balance between space efficiency and accuracy.
- **Disadvantages:** It can be harder to predict exactly how much space it will use.

### Binlogs and Recovery:
When you want to use binlogs for recovery, it's not just about re-executing SQL commands. If you're using row-based or mixed logging, the binlogs will have the exact data changes (not just the commands), allowing you to restore the database to a specific state very accurately.

- **For example:** If you accidentally delete a bunch of rows, you can replay the binlogs up to the point just before the deletion occurred, restoring the deleted rows.

### Imp Points:
- **Statement-Based Logging:** Stores SQL commands.
- **Row-Based Logging:** Stores the actual data changes.
- **Mixed Logging:** Uses a combination of both.

So, binlogs can indeed store more than just SQL commands—they can store the actual data changes, depending on the logging format, which is why they’re powerful for accurate replication and recovery.


#### Question: So I have lost data here, how will i get the data back from binlogs? as you said that row based logging stores the data changes only and not my entire data, lets says customer address data which i ingested, right? 


You're right to dig deeper into this, as it can be a bit confusing. Let's clarify how binlogs work in the context of data recovery, especially when data is lost.

### Understanding Row-Based Logging in Recovery

When I mentioned that row-based logging stores "data changes," this includes the *exact values* before and after a change. This is crucial for recovery. Here's how it works:

1. **Before the Deletion:**
   - Suppose you have a customer with an address stored in your database.
   - The row might look like this:
     ```sql
     id: 1, name: "John Doe", address: "123 Elm St"
     ```
   - This row is stored in the database.

2. **Accidental Deletion:**
   - You accidentally run a command like:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 1;
     ```
   - This deletes the row from the database.

3. **Row-Based Logging:**
   - When this deletion occurs, if you’re using row-based logging, the binlog records the change by noting that the row with `id: 1` was deleted. 
   - Crucially, the binlog entry includes the *exact* data of the deleted row (`id: 1, name: "John Doe", address: "123 Elm St"`) before the deletion.

### Recovering the Deleted Data

To recover from this accidental deletion using the binlogs, you would:

1. **Restore the Database to a Previous Backup:**
   - Ideally, you have a recent backup of your database. You restore the database from this backup. The backup would be up to the point before the deletion.

2. **Replay the Binlogs:**
   - After restoring the backup, you apply the binlogs, which contain all changes made since the backup.
   - You stop replaying the binlogs right *before* the deletion occurs.
   - This restores your database to the state it was in just before the deletion, with all the data intact, including the customer address that was deleted.

### What If There’s No Backup?

If you don’t have a recent backup, recovery becomes more complex, but the binlogs can still help:

- **Extracting Data from Binlogs:** If you have row-based binlogs, you can manually extract the deleted rows from the binlogs themselves since the logs contain the exact data that was deleted. Tools like `mysqlbinlog` can help you extract and replay specific events from the binlogs.

- **Point-in-Time Recovery:** You could roll back the database to the exact point just before the deletion using the binlogs, essentially "undoing" the deletion.

### Key Points:
- **Row-Based Binlogs:** They capture both the changes and the exact data before and after those changes. This allows you to restore deleted data.
- **Backups:** Binlogs are most effective when used in conjunction with regular backups for comprehensive recovery.
- **Recovery Process:** Restore from backup, then apply binlogs up to just before the unwanted changes.

So, even if you lose data, row-based binlogs can help you recover the exact data that was deleted because they store not just the fact that a row was deleted, but also what that row looked like before it was deleted.

### Key Takeaways:
- Binlogs are crucial for replication, recovery, and auditing.
- They record every data-modifying operation in a binary format.
- Binlogs allow you to replicate data across multiple servers and recover from mistakes or failures by replaying changes.

Think of binlogs as a detailed diary that records everything that happens to your database, allowing you to replicate those events on other databases or roll back time to fix mistakes.


### Considerations:
1. You can set limits on the size of each binlog file, so that we do not store a replication of data same as database in binlogs.
2. We can limit retention period of log collection (say 7 days) after which it will automatically get deleted from storage.


### Comparing MySQL binary logs (binlogs) to Django migration files

Comparing MySQL binary logs (binlogs) to Django migration files isn't entirely accurate, but there are some similarities worth noting.

**Similarities:**
- **Tracking Changes:** Both binlogs and Django migration files keep a record of changes made to the database. Binlogs record every change to the data (inserts, updates, deletes), while Django migration files track changes to the database schema (like creating or altering tables).
- **Replayable Changes:** Just as you can apply Django migrations to bring a database schema to a specific state, you can use binlogs to replay data changes to restore the database to a specific point in time.

**Differences:**
- **Scope:** Binlogs capture every data change, not just schema changes. In contrast, Django migrations focus specifically on schema changes (like creating or modifying tables, fields, indexes, etc.).
- **Purpose:** The primary purpose of binlogs is for replication and point-in-time recovery, while Django migrations are designed to manage the evolution of the database schema as the application evolves.
- **Format:** Binlogs are in a binary format and require special tools to read, while Django migration files are human-readable Python scripts.

So, while there's a conceptual overlap in tracking changes, binlogs and Django migration files serve different purposes and operate at different levels of the database management process.

## BinLogs: Things to consider

Let’s dive into some lesser-known but crucial aspects of MySQL binlogs that every data engineer should keep in mind. These insights can help you not only avoid pitfalls but also leverage binlogs more effectively in your data infrastructure.

### 1. Binlog Expiration: A Silent Data Killer
   - **What's the Deal?** MySQL automatically deletes old binlogs after a certain number of days (set by the `expire_logs_days` parameter). This can be a real problem if you’re not careful. Imagine needing to restore your database from a backup, only to find that the binlogs you need have been automatically deleted.
   - **Why It Matters:** Always monitor and manage binlog expiration settings, especially if you rely on them for replication or recovery. You don’t want to be caught off guard with missing logs.

### 2. Binlog Impact on Performance
   - **What's the Deal?** Writing to binlogs isn’t free—there’s a performance overhead involved. The more intensive your logging (especially with row-based logging), the more it can slow down your write operations.
   - **Why It Matters:** If you’re running a high-transaction environment, keep an eye on the performance hit from binlogging. Tuning your `sync_binlog` setting can help balance performance with data safety.

### 3. Partial Event Logging
   - **What's the Deal?** If a transaction is too large, MySQL might split it across multiple binlog files. This can be a bit tricky when you’re replaying logs or doing point-in-time recovery because you need to ensure all parts of the transaction are processed in the correct order.
   - **Why It Matters:** Be mindful when working with large transactions; if they span multiple binlogs, make sure your recovery process handles them correctly.

### 4. Binlog Replication: Filtering and Blackholing
   - **What's the Deal?** You can filter which databases or tables get logged using `binlog_do_db` and `binlog_ignore_db`. But here’s the catch: these settings apply at the session level, not globally. So, if your session switches databases, it might mess up which events get logged.
   - **Why It Matters:** Be careful with binlog filtering—misconfigurations can lead to missing critical changes in your logs. Also, consider using "blackhole" replication to safely discard certain data changes when you want to filter out logs without affecting performance.

### 5. GTIDs and Binlogs: A Match Made in Heaven (With a Catch)
   - **What's the Deal?** Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs) provide a unique ID for every transaction in your binlogs, making replication and failover more reliable. But if you enable GTIDs after running your database for a while, you might run into issues if your binlogs and GTID state don’t align.
   - **Why It Matters:** If you plan to use GTIDs, it’s best to enable them from the start. Retrofitting GTIDs onto an existing setup can lead to messy and hard-to-debug replication issues.

### 6. Binlog Compression: Save Space, But Watch Out
   - **What's the Deal?** MySQL 8.0 introduced binlog compression to save disk space. While this is great, it can complicate things during recovery or when using tools that aren’t compatible with compressed logs.
   - **Why It Matters:** Make sure your tools and processes are compatible with compressed binlogs before turning this feature on. Otherwise, you might save space at the cost of added complexity.

### 7. Checksum Validation: Integrity Check
   - **What's the Deal?** MySQL supports checksums for binlog events to detect corruption. However, not everyone uses it by default.
   - **Why It Matters:** If your binlogs get corrupted, you could be in big trouble during recovery or replication. Enabling checksums can help you catch issues early, saving you from headaches down the road.

### 8. Cross-Database Transactions: Tricky Territory
   - **What's the Deal?** If you run a transaction that touches multiple databases, and you’re using binlog filters, things can get hairy. MySQL might log only part of the transaction, leading to incomplete replication or recovery.
   - **Why It Matters:** Be cautious with cross-database transactions when using binlog filters. You might want to avoid them altogether to keep things clean and predictable.

### 9. Flushing Binlogs: Don’t Get Caught Off-Guard
   - **What's the Deal?** Flushing binlogs (using `FLUSH LOGS`) creates a new binlog file. But this can disrupt replication if done at the wrong time, especially in high-availability setups.
   - **Why It Matters:** Plan your binlog flushes carefully, especially during maintenance windows, to avoid unintended replication issues.

### 10. Binlog Size Management: Finding the Sweet Spot
   - **What's the Deal?** You can control the size of binlog files with `max_binlog_size`. Too small, and you’ll have too many files to manage; too large, and recovery times might increase.
   - **Why It Matters:** Find a balance that suits your environment—enough to avoid too many small files, but not so large that it complicates recovery and replication.

### Final Thought:
Understanding these nuances gives you more control over how MySQL behaves, especially in complex environments where replication and recovery are critical. Binlogs are powerful, but like any powerful tool, they need to be managed carefully to avoid pitfalls and get the most out of them.
