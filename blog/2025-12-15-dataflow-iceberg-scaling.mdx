# DataFlow Inc. scales analytics to 10x with Apache Iceberg integration

**DataFlow Inc.**, a B2B data analytics company, was experiencing growing pains as their customer base expanded. Their existing analytics infrastructure couldn't scale to handle the increasing data volumes, leading to performance degradation and customer complaints.

## The Challenge

DataFlow Inc. needed to:
- Scale analytics infrastructure to handle 10x more data volume
- Maintain query performance as data volumes increased
- Reduce infrastructure costs while scaling
- Support multiple customers with isolated data access

## The Solution

DataFlow Inc. migrated to Apache Iceberg with OLake:

1. **Scalable Storage**: Moved to object storage (S3) that scales automatically with data volume
2. **Apache Iceberg Tables**: Leveraged Iceberg's partitioning and metadata management for efficient querying
3. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Used Iceberg's table-level isolation for secure multi-tenant data access
4. **Real-time Data Ingestion**: Implemented CDC pipelines to keep analytics data fresh and up-to-date

## Results

- **10x increase** in data volume capacity
- **Maintained query performance** despite 10x data growth
- **40% reduction** in infrastructure costs per TB of data
- **100% customer satisfaction** improvement with faster query responses

## Technical Implementation

DataFlow Inc. integrated OLake to replicate data from customer databases to Apache Iceberg tables on S3. The open table format enabled efficient querying at scale, while the partitioning strategy ensured that queries remained fast even as data volumes grew exponentially.
