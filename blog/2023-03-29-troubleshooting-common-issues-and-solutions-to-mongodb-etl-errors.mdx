MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that allows for flexible and scalable data storage, querying and manipulation. Its JSON-like document format allows for dynamic schema design and easy representation of complex data structures.

Users may encounter MongoDB ETL errors while using MongoDB. So, understanding the common MongoDB ETL errors and implementing best practices can minimize issues and optimize the MongoDB experience

In this article, we will be exploring the different types of best practices to set up MongoDB for ETL (extraction, transformation, and loading errors) and also analytics. Further, we will work on troubleshooting the common issues of MongoDB ETL errors

## Setting up MongoDB for ETL

Before diving into the MongoDB ETL issues, let us understand some of the best practices for setting up MongoDB for ETL. Depending on your budget, infrastructure requirements, and use case, there are several ways to set up MongoDB. Some of them are listed as follows.


### Local Installation

Installing MongoDB on your development environment or local machine is typically used for development and testing purposes.

Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system from the MongoDB documentation:

* [Windows users](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
    
* [macOS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
    
* [Linux](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/)
    

### Self-Hosted

You can set up MongoDB on your virtual machines or servers in a cloud environment or data center. This approach provides more control over the security, infrastructure, and configuration.

You can follow the installation instructions for various environments and platforms in the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

### Docker

You can run MongoDB using Docker containers, which simplifies deployment and ensures consistent environments. You can use the official [MongoDB Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/) to [set up a container running MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/article/quick-start-mongodb-docker/).

### MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed, global cloud database service provided by MongoDB. It allows you to easily deploy, operate, and scale your MongoDB instances in the cloud. With built-in automation, security, and monitoring features, Atlas simplifies the process of managing your databases and ensures optimal performance.

By choosing MongoDB Atlas, you can take advantage of the benefits of a managed service, including automatic backups, scaling, and patches, as well as a range of integrations with other cloud services.

To get started with MongoDB Atlas, sign up for an account and follow the guided setup to create and configure your cluster. You can choose from various cloud providers, regions, and instance sizes to best suit your needs.

Once your cluster is up and running, you can connect your ETL tools and applications using the provided connection strings and credentials.

## Maximizing MongoDB for Analytics

Before deep-diving into detailed solutions on addressing the MongoDB ETL issues, let’s first cover best practices to set up your MongoDB cluster in a way that doesn’t impact your operational database.

For this, we will discuss some of the MongoDB Analytics Setup Best Practices now.

* At the very least, always point your analytics client to a secondary node instead of your primary node from your analytics application, so that operational performance is not affected.
    
* **Configure a hidden replica set member** - This prevents this replica set member from becoming a primary. A hidden member maintains a copy of the primary’s data but is invisible to client applications and can thus be used for read-only analytics purposes. To connect to a hidden member, use the directConnect option.
    

### Example

```bash
mongodb://user:password@192.168.0.1:27017/?authSource=db&directConnection=True
```

If you are using MongoDB Atlas with an `M10` or larger cluster, set up an Analytics Node. Analytics Nodes isolate queries on read-only nodes that do not contend with operational workloads.

To connect, use a connection string like below:

```bash
mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@foo-q8x1v.mycluster.com/test?readPreference=secondary&readPreferenceTags=nodeType:ANALYTICS
```

Let us now divide these common MongoDB ETL errors and issues in Atlas based on their category and try to understand some quick solutions to tackle them.

## Common Errors when connecting to MongoDB Atlas

### Connection timeout errors

This comes under one of the MongoDB ETL connector errors and occurs when the connector takes too long to establish a connection with the MongoDB Atlas cluster.

**Solution:** One way around this is to Increase the connection timeout value in your connector configuration or check your network connectivity to ensure a stable connection.

### Authentication errors

These arise when the connector uses incorrect credentials to connect to the Atlas cluster.

**Solution:** Some ways to work around these are to double-check your Atlas username and password, ensuring that the user has the correct privileges to access the cluster.

### TLS/SSL certificate errors

These occur when the connector cannot validate the Atlas cluster's SSL certificate.

**Solution:** To tackle this, make sure to include the appropriate CA (Certificate Authority) certificate in your connector's configuration. This will enable it to establish a secure connection.

### IP access list errors

These happen when your application's `IP` address is not whitelisted in the MongoDB Atlas cluster.

**Solution:** Adding your application's IP address to the Atlas cluster's IP access list or using a `CIDR` block to allow a range of IP addresses might help to handle these errors.

### Incorrect connection string

This error occurs when your connector's configuration uses an incorrect connection string.

**Solution:** Verify that the connection string in your configuration matches the one provided in the MongoDB Atlas dashboard. This ensures that it includes the correct cluster address and replica set information.

### DNS resolution errors

These happen when the connector cannot resolve the domain name in the connection string.

**Solution:** Check your DNS settings, and ensure that your system can resolve the Atlas cluster's domain name.

### Exceeded a maximum number of connections

This error occurs when your application attempts to open more connections than allowed by the Atlas cluster's maximum connection limit.

**Solution:** Either Close any unused connections or if applicable, increase the maximum connection limit in your Atlas cluster's settings.

### Driver compatibility issues

These arise when your connector's driver is incompatible with the version of MongoDB used in your Atlas cluster.

**Solution:** Update your connector's driver to the latest version or one that is compatible with your Atlas cluster's MongoDB version.

**Note:** Each error's solution may vary depending on the specific circumstances, and the above solutions serve as a general guide. Consult the [MongoDB Atlas documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/) and relevant forums for more details on troubleshooting and resolving these common errors.

**Most Common MongoDB ETL Errors**

![troubleshooting-common-issues-and-solutions-to-mongodb-etl-errors-1](/img/blog/2023/03/troubleshooting-common-issues-and-solutions-to-mongodb-etl-errors-1.webp)

Now, let us discuss some of the various MongoDB ETL errors or ELT errors that users have reported when trying to use ETL tools. These include popular platforms like Fivetran, Hevo Data, Talend, and Airbyte with the MongoDB database. Some of these include the following.

### “Connection refused” error

Occurs when the ETL tool is unable to connect to the MongoDB server due to network issues or incorrect connection settings from the user’s end.

### "Invalid credentials" error

Usually occurs when the credentials provided to the ETL tool to authenticate with the MongoDB server are either incorrect or do not have the required permissions to access the database.

### "Unable to fetch collections” error

This error usually occurs when the ETL tool is unable to fetch the collections from the MongoDB server. This can happen if there are network issues or the server is down.

### "SSL certificate error"

This occurs when the ETL tool is unable to verify the SSL certificate provided by the MongoDB server. This can happen if the certificate is either invalid or if the ETL tool does not have the necessary CA certificates installed.

### "Timeout error"

Occurs when the ETL tool is unable to connect to the MongoDB server within the specified timeout period.

This can happen due to any of the following reasons:

* Network issues
    
* Server downtime
    
* Incorrect connection settings.
    

### "Data type mismatch"

This shows up when the ETL tool is unable to map the data types from MongoDB to the target database. This can happen if the data types in MongoDB and the target database are incompatible.

### "Duplicate key error"

This happens when the MongoDB ETL tool is unable to insert a record into the target database due to a duplicate key violation. This occurs if the target database already contains a record with the same key as the record being inserted.

## Popular MongoDB ETL Errors

### Timed out after 30000 ms while waiting to connect

This error is a connection error where the ETL tool is unable to  establish a connection with the MondoDB server.

**Error Message**

```plaintext
Client view of cluster state is {type=UNKNOWN, servers=[{address=<REDACTED_DOMAIN>.mongodb.net:27017, type=UNKNOWN, state=CONNECTING, exception={com.mongodb.MongoSocketException: <REDACTED_DOMAIN>.mongodb.net}, caused by {java.net.UnknownHostException: <REDACTED_DOMAIN>.mongodb.net} }]
```

**Root Cause**

The error you're encountering indicates a connection timeout. The client was unable to connect to the MongoDB cluster after waiting for 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds).

The root cause of this error appears to be a DNS resolution issue, as seen from the `java.net.UnknownHostException` in the error message.

```plaintext
The client cannot resolve the domain name (<REDACTED_DOMAIN>.mongodb.net) provided in the connection string. This issue prevents the client from establishing a connection with the MongoDB Atlas cluster.
```

**Possible solutions**

Verify the connection string: Double-check the connection string to ensure it's correct and matches the one provided in the MongoDB Atlas dashboard. Make sure there are no typographical errors or missing information in the domain name.

**Check your DNS settings:** Ensure that your system is properly configured to resolve domain names. You can test the DNS resolution using tools like `nslookup` or dig (on Unix-based systems) or by trying to access the domain in a web browser.

**Use a different DNS resolver:** If the issue persists, consider changing your system's DNS resolver to a public DNS service like Google's Public DNS (`8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`) or Cloudflare's DNS (`1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1`).

**Firewall or network restrictions:** Check if there are any firewall rules or network restrictions in place that could be blocking the DNS resolution or the connection to the MongoDB Atlas cluster.

**Inspect the host's file:** In some cases, the issue may arise from incorrect entries in the system's hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Unix-based systems or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows). Check the file to ensure that there are no conflicting or incorrect entries.

Restart your system or network devices: Sometimes, a simple restart of your computer, modem, or router can help resolve temporary connectivity issues.

### 'Failed to Fetch Schema' Error in MongoDB ETL

The "MongoDB Failed to fetch Schema" error is one of the MongoDB data integration problems and arises during ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. This occurs when an ETL tool or data integration platform cannot accurately determine the structure of the data within the MongoDB collection.

**Root Causes**

This error typically arises due to the following reasons:

**Dynamic schema:** MongoDB is a schema-less, document-oriented database that allows flexible data storage in `BSON` format. Documents within the same collection can have different structures or varying data types for the same field. This dynamic schema can make it challenging for ETL tools to accurately map the data structure.

**Insufficient data sampling:** When an ETL tool attempts to infer the schema from a MongoDB collection, it may use sampling techniques to analyze a subset of documents. If the sample size is too small or unrepresentative of the overall data, the inferred schema may not accurately reflect the data's structure, leading to the error.

**Incompatible data types:** Some ETL tools may not support all BSON data types used by MongoDB, such as `Decimal128` or `ObjectID`. If the source collection contains unsupported data types, the ETL tool may fail to fetch the schema.

**Connectivity issues:** If the ETL tool cannot establish a stable connection with the MongoDB instance, it may fail to fetch the schema. This can be due to network issues, incorrect connection parameters, or IP whitelisting problems.

**Possible Solutions**

To resolve the "*MongoDB Failed to fetch Schema*" error during ETL, consider the following solutions:

**Manual schema definition:** Manually define a JSON schema that accurately represents the data structure in MongoDB. This approach requires a deep understanding of the source data and may need updates if the data structure changes.

**Improve data sampling:** Increase the sample size or use more representative samples when inferring the schema, ensuring that the ETL tool captures the variations in the data structure.

**Data type conversions:** If the ETL tool does not support specific BSON data types, convert them to compatible data types before the ETL process.

**Address connectivity issues:** Check the connection parameters, network settings, and IP whitelisting to ensure a stable connection between the ETL tool and MongoDB instance.

**Use a compatible ETL tool:** Choose an ETL tool or data integration platform that offers better support for MongoDB's dynamic schema and BSON data types.

### The Airbyte MongoDB connector “schema discovery issue”

Airbyte is an open-source data integration platform that simplifies ETL by using connectors to interact with different data sources and destinations, including MongoDB.

However, the MongoDB connector faces challenges with schema discovery due to the dynamic nature of MongoDB's schema. MongoDB's schema-less, the document-oriented format allows for storing unstructured and semi-structured data in a flexible BSON format, resulting in varying structures and data types within the same collection.

**Root Cause**

The schema discovery issue arises when the Airbyte MongoDB connector tries to infer the schema from the source MongoDB collection. Due to the lack of a fixed schema, it can be challenging for the connector to determine the exact structure of the data, especially if the collection has a high degree of variability.

**Possible Solutions**

To address the schema discovery issue with the Airbyte MongoDB connector, you can consider the following approaches.

**Schema inference:** The connector can use sampling techniques to analyze a subset of documents in the MongoDB collection and infer a schema based on the most common fields and data types. This approach may not cover all possible variations in the data but can provide a reasonable approximation.

**Schema definition:** You can manually define a JSON schema for the MongoDB source data, ensuring that the schema accurately represents the data structure. This approach requires a deep understanding of the source data and may need to be updated if the data structure evolves over time.

**Schema evolution:** The connector can be designed to handle schema changes during the replication process. This involves updating the schema in the destination whenever new fields or data types are discovered. However, this approach may require additional complexity and processing overhead.

**Custom transformations:** You can implement custom data transformations before ingesting the data into Airbyte to normalize the schema or convert semi-structured data (e.g., JSON or XML) into a structured format that can be more easily mapped by the connector.

## Common Errors when syncing multi-document transactions from MongoDB

When syncing multi-document transactions from MongoDB using ETL tools like Airbyte, Fivetran or Hevo Data, you might encounter the following error examples:

### Unsupported MongoDB version

**Example:** "Error: MongoDB version not supported for multi-document transactions."

Multi-document transactions are only supported in `MongoDB 4.0` and later for replica sets, and 4.2 and later for sharded clusters. Ensure that you are using a compatible version of MongoDB before attempting to sync multi-document transactions.

### Connector configuration error

**Example:** "Error: Invalid connector configuration for syncing multi-document transactions."

This error occurs when the connector settings in Airbyte or Hevo Data are not configured correctly to handle multi-document transactions. Review the connector settings and ensure they are correctly set up for multi-document transaction syncing.

### Incomplete or partial transaction data

**Example:** "Error: Incomplete transaction data received."

This error can occur when the source MongoDB database is experiencing high load, causing the connector to receive incomplete or partial transaction data. Ensure that the source MongoDB instance has sufficient resources to handle the workload, and consider increasing the connector's timeout settings to allow for more time to receive complete transaction data.

### Unsupported operations in transactions

**Example:** "Error: Unsupported operation in multi-document transaction."

Certain operations, such as creating or dropping collections, are not supported within multi-document transactions. If your transaction includes unsupported operations, you may encounter this error. To resolve this issue, remove unsupported operations from the transaction and perform them outside the transaction context.

### Data type mismatch or schema changes

**Example:** "Error: Data type mismatch or schema change detected in multi-document transaction."

This error occurs when the connector encounters a data type mismatch or schema change during the sync process. Ensure that the data types and schema in the source MongoDB database are consistent with the target data store. You might need to adjust the connector's settings to handle data type conversions or schema changes correctly.

## Custom solutions for syncing multi-document transactions from MongoDB

Many off-the-shelf tools may not support the complex nature of multi-document transactions. However, you can implement a custom solution that handles these transactions more effectively. Here's a high-level overview of how you can approach this:

1. **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Leverage MongoDB's oplog (operation log) or Change Streams to capture changes, including multi-document transactions, in real-time. Oplog is a capped collection that stores an ordered history of logical write operations on a MongoDB replica set, while Change Streams provide real-time data change notifications through MongoDB's aggregation framework.
    
2. **Data Transformation:** Process the captured changes and transform the data into a format that is compatible with BigQuery. This may involve normalizing the data, converting data types, and handling nested structures.
    
3. **Transaction Handling:** Ensure your custom ELT solution can handle multi-document transactions by:
    

a. Identifying transactions in the oplog or Change Streams. Transactions are represented as a series of operations with a unique transaction ID (`txnId`). Group operations with the same txnId together to process them as a single unit.

b. Ensuring consistency and atomicity when applying changes to BigQuery. One approach is to stage the changes in a temporary table or dataset in BigQuery, and then apply them as a single transaction using BigQuery's support for DML transactions.

3. **Incremental Updates:** Design the custom ELT job to perform incremental updates, minimizing the data transfer and processing overhead. This helps in addressing and resolving MongoDB data migration problems. Keep track of the last processed operation's timestamp or resume token in the oplog or Change Streams, and use it to fetch only new changes during the next run.

4\. **Error Handling and Monitoring:** Implement robust error handling and monitoring to ensure that the custom ELT job is resilient to failures and provides visibility into the data sync process.

4\. **Scheduling and Orchestration:** Use a scheduling and orchestration tool like Apache Airflow to automate and manage the custom ELT job's execution.
