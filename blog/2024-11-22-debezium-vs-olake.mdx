Change Data Capture (CDC) is essential for modern data architectures that require real-time data replication and synchronization across systems. Debezium (a Java utility based on the Qurkus framework), coupled with Apache Kafka, has become a popular open-source solution for implementing CDC.

However, while this combination offers powerful capabilities, it also comes with significant drawbacks that can impact your organization's efficiency and resources.

[Common Challenges Using Debezium and Kafka Connect for CDC](https://datazip.io/blog/issues-debezium-kafka)

In the previous article we discussed in details about all the common challenges with Debezium, and now here, we present you an better open source alternative to debezium + kafka setup.

In this article we will see how OLake solves most of the problems that exist with your current Debezium + Kafka Connect setup.

## **Introducing OLake (Open Source Alternative to Debezium + Kafka Setup)**

## **1\. Purpose and Overview**

| **Feature** | **Olake** | **Debezium + Kafka** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Description** | Fastest open-source platform for real-time ingestion and normalization of tables, and collections ( MongoDB, currently) data into data Lakeshouses (*Iceberg on S3*) with minimal coding and single component architecture. | An open-source CDC tool that streams changes from MongoDB to Kafka for real-time data processing. |
| **Best For** | Data teams seeking fault-proof, streamlined pipelines to replicate huge data into a lakehouse for analytics use cases. | Organizations with existing Kafka-based architectures needing robust CDC for MongoDB **without** built-in transformation capabilities. |

## **2\. Installation and Setup**

### **Installation Options and Ease of Setup**

| **Feature** | **Olake** | **Debezium + Kafka** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Installation Options** | \- Open-source & **Self-Hosted**. Deploy on standalone machines with flexibility. | **\-** Open-Source |
| **Ease of Setup** | \- User-friendly, code-free interface with Docker support for quick deployment. Minimal configuration required. | Complex setup requiring detailed knowledge of Kafka clusters, Debezium connectors, and potential DevOps support. **NO UI.** |
| **Example** | As planned launch on popular market places, soon with one-click install as a managed service. | Install Kafka and ZooKeeper → Configure Debezium connectors → Develop custom scripts for scaling and monitoring. |

## **3\. Data Processing**

### **ELT Capabilities and Transformation**

| **Feature** | **Olake** | **Debezium + Kafka** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ELT Functionality** | Fully automated ELT: extraction, data merging, schema and table creation, data type conversion. | Only handles data extraction (CDC). Loading and transformation require custom coding or additional tools. |
| **Data Transformation** | Automated parsing, extraction, flattening, and transformation of nested `JSON` (semi-structured data) into relational streams / tables. | Requires Kafka Streams or KSQL for transformations, necessitating additional setup and coding. |
| **JSON Array Flattening** | Arrays are exploded into separate tables with primary and foreign keys relationship (Flatbread by Datazip). | No native support, outside of Debezium product |
| **Schema Handling** | Automatically manages schema changes and complex polymorphic (changing key types, `INT`\-&gt; `STRING`) data without manual intervention. | Minimal schema change support; complex changes may require manual intervention and risk schema drift. |
| **Historical Data Handling** | Automatically handles both historical and real-time data seamlessly with incremental snapshotting. | Manual backfill processes needed for historical data; requires maintaining large Kafka log retention or manual snapshotting. |
| **CDC Impact** | Change Data Capture (CDC) utilizes a log-based approach, enabling replication through parallel and multithreaded loading, as well as partitioning and compression techniques. | Snapshotting is incremental but not concurrent, meaning large tables with millions of rows may take hours to complete. During this process, tables remain inaccessible until snapshotting finishes. |

## **4\. Performance, Scalability and Rich Feature**

| **Feature** | **Olake** | **Debezium + Kafka** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Full Data Sync Speed** | \- Up to **15x faster** full data sync compared to Debezium. | Dependent on Debezium snapshotKafka performance. |
| **Incremental Sync Speed** | **\- 27.3x faster** incremental synchronization, enabling rapid updates and real-time data availability. | Dependent on Debezium CDC performance; JVM and processing CDC in sequential way affects severely. |
| **Scalability** | \- Automatically handles large datasets with parallel processing by breaking large collections into chunks. | Requires manual scaling of Kafka brokers and connectors, which can be complex and resource-intensive. |
| **Snapshotting** | Incremental and automatic snapshotting, enabling seamless historical data integration. | Manual and time-consuming snapshots, and potentially causing lag to read large tables. |
| **Backpressure and Resource Limitations** | Olake monitors data flow and automatically scales resources to handle high volumes, preventing backpressure and ensuring consistent performance | \- Possibility of data loss from Consumer lag |
| **Latency** | \- **Near real-time** replication (1-minute benchmark). | \- Real-time streaming with low latency possible. |
| **Data Type Support** | Supports handling of most commonly used data types (natively supported of each source) including BLOB types. | Certain Debezium connectors have limitations with specific data types; for example, the Oracle connector has restrictions when handling the BLOB data type. |

## **5\. Cost Efficiency**

### **Cost Comparison**

| **Feature** | **Olake** | **Debezium + Kafka** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pricing Model** | **Open-Source**: Free to use with no licensing fees. | **Open-Source**: Free to use, but incurs costs related to infrastructure and maintenance. |
| **Cost Comparison** | \- **20x cheaper than Fivetran**. | \- **Infrastructure Costs**: Maintaining Kafka clusters can be expensive, especially at scale. |
| **Example** | A medium-sized company can implement Olake for approximately $300/month, saving significantly compared to managed alternatives. | A similar company might spend $900 - $1200 monthly on cloud resources and DevOps labor to maintain a Debezium + Kafka setup. |
